        "question": "Complete the threat assessment by making assessments for scope and severity for the \"Vicu\u00f1a\" (\"Vicugna vicugna\"). \n\nHere are the scoring instructions from the IUCN: For each threat, it is recommended that the scope (i.e., the proportion of the total population affected) and severity (i.e., the overall declines caused by the threat) should be recorded. Severity should be scored within the scope of the particular threat. For example, if hunting (i.e., threat code 5.1.1) is identified as a threat within one particular region only, the severity is scored as the % rate of decline to the population within that region only.\n\nThe threat description from IUCN is \"Poaching triggered by international illegal market demands of Vicu\u00f1a fibre continues to be the major threat to the species. According to the Technical Meeting of the Vicu\u00f1a Convention (2015) there has been, with the exception of Ecuador, an alarming increase in Vicu\u00f1a poaching throughout its range, especially affecting isolated Chilean and relict populations whose marginal distribution increases their vulnerability. Among the factors that facilitate poaching of Vicu\u00f1as in the high Andes are (SACSG, 2014): 1) The wide geographic range of Vicu\u00f1a populations and the extensive long frontier areas among the countries involved; 2) The geographic characteristics of the area, with low Vicu\u00f1a population densities and a high degree of isolation; 3) Lack of human and technical resources devoted to protection of the species in the host countries; 4) High value of the fibre and Vicu\u00f1a products in the international market; 5) Existence of a substantial market for illegal fibre and handcrafts at the local level; 6) Lack of effective punishment for illegal hunters; 7) Insufficient confiscation of illegal products; 8) Limited coordinated security forces within and between countries; 9) Limited benefits to local communities, and sometimes insufficient support and incentives to develop legal Vicu\u00f1a use, resulting in greater benefits from illegal than from legal uses. Thus, it is considered of particular relevance that the following measures to be promoted:A) On cooperation among Andean countries:1. Intensification of inter-boundary cooperation among neighbouring countries, including security forces, for the control of international frontiers to optimize efforts to eliminate illegal traffic.2. Critical revision of the compliance with previous agreements and documents, developed during Technical Meetings of the Vicu\u00f1a Convention on Vicu\u00f1a poaching and trafficking.3. Standardized registry in the five countries of legally obtained fibre, its processing, imports and exports, in order to be able to monitor its commercialization.B) At the national level:1. Information dissemination regarding legal sanctions and the updating of national, regional, and local laws to make them more effective against poaching and illegal commercialization of Vicu\u00f1a fibre and products.2. Facilitation and support of local Andean communities in the development of technical and organizational capacities to harvest fibre from their Vicu\u00f1as under strict animal welfare protocols and strengthening local community organizations.3. Governmental support to local Andean communities in the commercialization and value-added processes of legal fibre, simplifying the process and strengthening the stages of the legal chain of commercialization.4. Supply of sufficient legal fibre for local artisan use at subsidized prices, to minimize use of illegal fibre and increasing value added processes in the countries of origin.5. Reinforcing and implementation at the national level of schemes of supervision, legal oversight, and tracing origins of the fibre, from shearing to its conclusion on the supply chain (shearing, storage, transformation, commercialization, and export).6. Permanent training of police, judicial and customs authorities, with respect to legislation and other subjects related to production and movement of fibre, as well as identification of camelid fibres and their sub-products.7. The intensification of seizures of illegal clothing and the implementation of sanctions to those involved in purchasing or selling them.8. Implementation of informative and awareness campaigns, especially at touristic sites and airports, alerting tourists of the requirements to be met by legal Vicu\u00f1a fibre products.C) On the cooperation between exporting and importing countries:1. Strengthening of local cooperation networks and swifter communication between CITES authorities and importing and exporting countries.2. Development and collaboration in the implementation of systems to trace the origin of Vicu\u00f1a products and sub-products, to be implemented internationally.3. The strengthening of controls in the importing countries regarding the processing and marketing Vicu\u00f1a products and sub-products.Despite the fact that participating countries are moving forward in the development of National Management and Conservation plans since the last Vicu\u00f1a assessment (2008), as well as the provision of guidelines for sustainable management and animal welfare criteria, the lack of specific budgets or poor funding hinder achievement of conservation and management actions. Recent studies have shown that capture, handling, live-shearing and releasing wild Vicu\u00f1as under strict sustainable management and welfare protocols (although showing subtle and transitory behavioural and social structure changes after being released) does not compromise the conservation or maintenance of ecologically functional wild populations (Sahley et al. 2007, Arzamendia and Vil\u00e1 2012, Marcoppido et al. 2017). Among the two widely used methods for capturing Vicu\u00f1as, the traditional \u2018Chaku\u2019 (surround-capture by people on foot) results in less stress on animals than the use of motor vehicles to chase the animals (Sarno et al. 2009, Arzamendia et al. 2010). On the other hand, captive management has proven to have no contribution to Vicu\u00f1a conservation (Lichtenstein 2006). Vicu\u00f1as, domestic camelids and introduced livestock have similar foraging preferences and share Andean habitats. As a result, local people perceive Vicu\u00f1as as a competitive species, and do not tolerate their presence (Lichtenstein and Renaudeau d'Arc 2004). This is especially worrisome around wetland (bofedales) habitats which are critical for Vicu\u00f1as (Koford 1957, Renaudeau d'Arc et al. 2000, Mosca Torres and Puig 2012, Mosca Torres et al. 2015) and locally shared with domestic animals (Borgnia et al. 2008, Wurstten et al. 2014, Arzamendia and Vil\u00e1 2015, McLaren et al. 2018). Vicu\u00f1as are frequently displaced by livestock, from the high-quality habitats to sub-optimal low-productivity habitats (Borgnia et al. 2008), where they still are able to persist. Further, the presence of herders with dogs represents an important stress factor for Vicu\u00f1as (Arzamendia and Vil\u00e1 2015). Habitat loss triggered by livestock over-grazing, and habitat fragmentation due to industrial and rural sprawl, and the development of large-scale mining projects may jeopardize the viability of Vicu\u00f1a populations located beyond protected areas. Mining activities directly impact Vicu\u00f1a populations by occupying preferred habitats and as a result of road kills due to high traffic levels, heavy machinery employed etc., and indirectly through the extraction and pollution of water resources (Mata et al. 2016).Climate change will probably have a detrimental impact in the fragile ecosystems where Vicu\u00f1as occur since they are at the limits of habitable environments. Therefore, the assessment of the potential effects of climate change on Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s habitats is a priority.Epidemiological studies on Vicu\u00f1a wild populations in Bolivia, Per\u00fa and Argentina that share spatial and forage resources with domestic camelids and livestock do not show prevalence levels of endo- or ectoparasites that seem to be a problem for the viability of their populations (Ch\u00e1vez-Vel\u00e1squez et al. 2005, Beltr\u00e1n-Saavedra et al. 2011, Arzamendia et al. 2012, Marcoppido et al. 2016). However, a growing concern is emerging since some Vicu\u00f1a populations throughout their distribution are suffering from mange caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. For example, two important protected areas for the species\u2019 conservation are showing a high incidence of mange: San Guillermo National Park (San Juan, Argentina), created to preserve the two South American wild camelids in Argentina, and Pampa Galeras B\u00e1rbara D\u2019Achille National Reserve (Ayachuco, Per\u00fa), the latter which symbolized the recovery of the species from the brick of extinction in the 60s of the past century. In San Guillermo the problem probably has to do with the introduction of domestic camelids without sanitary controls or quarantine, while in the case of other populations it is due to mismanagement practices related to the capture and shearing of animals, including incomplete preventive veterinary treatments, management without welfare, and overcrowding of animals creating stress. This situation also causes huge economic losses to the local communities because of the drop of Vicu\u00f1a fibre price. A potential threat both in the Andes and worldwide, is the breeding of paco-Vicu\u00f1a (an alpaca/Vicu\u00f1a hybrid) mainly promoted in developed countries out of the Vicu\u00f1a distribution range for commercial purposes. The alpaca was domesticated from the Vicu\u00f1a approximately 6-7,000 years ago (Wheeler 2012). During domestication and subsequent selective breeding, the genome was modified away from its Vicu\u00f1a origin. Additional significant changes in the alpaca genome also occurred during the Spanish conquest when large numbers were slaughtered, and subsequent massive hybridization with llamas. DNA studies have shown that alpaca and llama pertain to different genera, Vicugna and Lama respectively, and at least 80% of alpacas in the Andes carry llama genes (Kadwell et al. 2001). Thus, hybridization between alpacas and Vicu\u00f1as represents a real threat because of the mixing of alpaca genes into the Vicu\u00f1a genome, something that has not occurred in nature.\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 7.2 Dams & water management/use. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 7, Name: 'Natural System Modifications', Description: 'Threats from actions that convert or degrade habitat in service of managing natural or semi-natural systems, often to improve human welfare.'\nCode: 7.2, Name: 'Dams & Water Management/Use', Description: 'Changing water flow patterns from their natural range of variation either deliberately or as a result of other activities.'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

All of these factors are the consequences of intensification of agricultural practices (Carroll et al. 2020), causing significant stressors despite the species' adaptability to agricultural habitats.

Human populations are increasing and expanding. In the last census, the Amazon region registered the highest population growth in Brazil. Illegal settlements, road opening and deforestation threaten pristine habitats. Colonization of new areas are expected, followed by intensive exploitation of natural resources. Furthermore, proposed mega-projects in the 2007 Brazilian Growth Acceleration Plan represent a significant threat to Brazilian Amazonian and Pantanal habitats. Changes in government and environmental protection policies in Brazil endanger the pristine areas of the Amazon, Pantanal and Cerrado. Between 2017 and 2019 4,500 km\u00b2 of the Amazon were lost due to deforestation and burning, of which 65% occurred in 2019 (Cannon 2019, https://news.mongabay.com/2019/11/deforestation-preceded-fires-in-massive-area-of-amazon-in-2019/). From August to November of 2019, at least 1.5 million hectares of Brazilian Pantanal were burned (https://www.dw.com/en/brazils-next-fire-disaster-in-the-pantanal-wetlands/a-51199164). Hunting for the pelt trade was the greatest threat to the Giant Otter in the past and the species came close to extinction in the early 1970s in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazilian Pantanal (Duplaix 1980). From 1960 to 1969, records indicated a regional harvest of 12,390 giant otter skins. In 1973, giant otters were placed on CITES Appendix I, and the enforcement of international trade restrictions on Giant Otter skins in 1975 finally ended Giant Otter hunting (Recharte and Bodmer 2010). The Giant Otter remains endangered because of the low recuperation rate of relict populations now also under pressure from human activities (Groenendijk et al. 2015). Direct conflict between humans and otters is an increasing problem. Otters may be killed for fun or out of fear, or, more often, because they are seen as competitors for fish by loggers, miners, and fishermen, who often blame them for depleting fish resources used for local and commercial consumption (G\u00f3mez and Jorgensen 1999, Recharte et al. 2008, Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2012, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Giant Otters can drown in fishing nets and traps and are also blamed for damaging them (Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2012, Utreras et al. 2013). Fish farming is rapidly increasing in the species\u2019 range, for example in parts of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and expose otters to retaliation killing (V. Utreras pers. obs.). Cubs are sometimes captured illegally to be kept as pets (M. Marmontel pers. obs). Giant Otters are highly susceptible to persecution: they are large, conspicuous, social, and very vocal. They are active at daytime and occupy open habitats and stable territories. Their signs\u2014latrines and dens\u2014are easily recognizable, making it possible to identify areas of recent activity by a group (Groenendijk et al. 2005). Individuals and groups often react to people by approaching to investigate. Moreover, only the dominant pair produces young, and usually only once a year. During the pelt trade years, these life history attributes made them an easy target for fishermen. In 2017, a Giant Otter group was killed by fishermen in the Pantanal and according to locals, kills occur frequently during the fishing season (C. Leuchtenberger pers. obs.). In 2011\u20132012, the Kanamari indigenous people promoted a massive Giant Otter killing in their territory (Territ\u00f3rio Ind\u00edgena Kanamari), based on their perception that the species was overfishing the river turtle population. The community leader bought 300 cartridges for the hunters, who shot 64 Giant Otters (Endo pers. comm. 2012). Such incidents of targeted killing can lead to extinction of small populations in a watershed. Gold mining, artisanal as well as industrial, is a significant threat to the species, particularly in the Guiana Shield region, in southeastern Peru, the western region of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and northern Pantanal. The main impacts are habitat destruction, sedimentation of rivers, and pollution (Kimbrough 2014). Gold miners cut swathes into the floodplain forest and blast river banks with pressure hoses, using mercury to amalgamate gold particles. Gold prices are at a record high, whereas mercury is inexpensive. Forest conversion to mining increased six-fold from 2003\u20132006 to 2006\u20132009 (Swenson et al. 2011). Even a decade after mining stopped, areas affected still had depleted fish populations and had not been re-colonized by otters. In areas of gold mining, fish are contaminated with mercury. Gutleb et al. (1997) found that mercury concentrations in the majority of fish near Manu National Park were higher than considered tolerable for the Eurasian otter. Migration of contaminated fish and long-range atmospheric transport of mercury probably increase the area of influence of such contaminants. Contamination of otters by other heavy metals through pesticides and other agrochemicals is still poorly understood. The many planned hydroelectric dams in the species\u2019 range are a major threat to Giant Otters. These will alter hydrological regimes of rivers and affect fish populations and habitat (Latrubesse et al. 2017). Dams disrupt the annual cycles of inundations, vital for the maintenance of populations of flood dependent species such as the Giant Otter (Mour\u00e3o et al. 2010, Alho and Sabino 2011). One hundred and eighty-four new dams are planned or under construction, greater than two MW capacity over the next 20 years in the Amazon. These dams would include five of the six major Andean tributaries of the Amazon. Sixty per cent of the dams would cause the first major break in connectivity between protected Andean headwaters and the lowland Amazon. Giant Otters are able to live in some artificial lakes, such as the shallow Balbina Reservoir in Brazil (Rosas et al. 2007). In other areas, hydroelectric dams have depleted Giant Otter populations, as did the Curu\u00e1-Una Hydroelectric in the Brazilian Amazonia (Rosas et al. 2007). Around the Pantanal, there are over 115 projects of small hydroelectric plants. Other major infrastructure projects include the Inter-oceanic highway in southeastern Peru, and the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America (V. Utreras pers. comm. 2012). Giant Otters are vulnerable to disturbance from poorly managed tourism, including sport fishing. It is important to control increasing levels of tourism on lakes and rivers both in and outside protected areas (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Research has shown that Giant Otter reproductive success and sighting success by tourists is considerably lower on unmanaged lakes than on managed lakes (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Giant Otter cubs held in captivity have died of canine parvovirus, and all mustelids are susceptible to canine distemper, so domestic animal diseases may pose a serious threat to wild Giant Otter populations. Infection can also occur in remote areas, since transient otters and people hunting with dogs travel large distances with potential for contact and infection of vulnerable otter populations (Schenck et al. 1999). Climatic changes are predicted to increase suitable areas for Giant Otters (Cianfrani et al. 2018). However, long-term habitat and climatic modifications will increase the exposure of suitable core otter areas to the negative effects of the surrounding unsuitable areas (Cianfrani et al. 2018). The species also has a high specialized niche, making it more vulnerable to climate change.\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 2.3.3 Agro-industry grazing, ranching or farming. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 2, Name: 'Agriculture & Aquaculture', Description: 'Threats from farming and ranching as a result of agricultural expansion and intensification, including silviculture, mariculture and aquaculture (includes the impacts of any fencing around farmed areas)'\nCode: 2.3, Name: 'Livestock Farming & Ranching', Description: 'Domestic terrestrial animals raised in one location on farmed or non-local resources (farming); also domestic or semi-domesticated animals allowed to roam in the wild and supported by natural habitats (ranching).'\nCode: 2.3.3, Name: 'Agro-industry Grazing, Ranching or Farming'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

        "question": "Complete the threat assessment by making assessments for scope and severity for the \"Giant Otter\" (\"Pteronura brasiliensis\"). \n\nHere are the scoring instructions from the IUCN: For each threat, it is recommended that the scope (i.e., the proportion of the total population affected) and severity (i.e., the overall declines caused by the threat) should be recorded. Severity should be scored within the scope of the particular threat. For example, if hunting (i.e., threat code 5.1.1) is identified as a threat within one particular region only, the severity is scored as the % rate of decline to the population within that region only.\n\nThe threat description from IUCN is \"The species is threatened by multiple human activities throughout its range, destruction of riparian habitat, overfishing, contamination of water bodies\u2014especially by gold mining, fossil fuel exploration, and the use of pesticides and fertilizers, diseases spread by domestic animals, and mismanaged tourism (Duplaix 1980, Schenck 1999, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Human populations are increasing and expanding. In the last census, the Amazon region registered the highest population growth in Brazil. Illegal settlements, road opening and deforestation threaten pristine habitats. Colonization of new areas are expected, followed by intensive exploitation of natural resources. Furthermore, proposed mega-projects in the 2007 Brazilian Growth Acceleration Plan represent a significant threat to Brazilian Amazonian and Pantanal habitats. Changes in government and environmental protection policies in Brazil endanger the pristine areas of the Amazon, Pantanal and Cerrado. Between 2017 and 2019 4,500 km\u00b2 of the Amazon were lost due to deforestation and burning, of which 65% occurred in 2019 (Cannon 2019, https://news.mongabay.com/2019/11/deforestation-preceded-fires-in-massive-area-of-amazon-in-2019/). From August to November of 2019, at least 1.5 million hectares of Brazilian Pantanal were burned (https://www.dw.com/en/brazils-next-fire-disaster-in-the-pantanal-wetlands/a-51199164). Hunting for the pelt trade was the greatest threat to the Giant Otter in the past and the species came close to extinction in the early 1970s in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazilian Pantanal (Duplaix 1980). From 1960 to 1969, records indicated a regional harvest of 12,390 giant otter skins. In 1973, giant otters were placed on CITES Appendix I, and the enforcement of international trade restrictions on Giant Otter skins in 1975 finally ended Giant Otter hunting (Recharte and Bodmer 2010). The Giant Otter remains endangered because of the low recuperation rate of relict populations now also under pressure from human activities (Groenendijk et al. 2015). Direct conflict between humans and otters is an increasing problem. Otters may be killed for fun or out of fear, or, more often, because they are seen as competitors for fish by loggers, miners, and fishermen, who often blame them for depleting fish resources used for local and commercial consumption (G\u00f3mez and Jorgensen 1999, Recharte et al. 2008, Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2012, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Giant Otters can drown in fishing nets and traps and are also blamed for damaging them (Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2012, Utreras et al. 2013). Fish farming is rapidly increasing in the species\u2019 range, for example in parts of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and expose otters to retaliation killing (V. Utreras pers. obs.). Cubs are sometimes captured illegally to be kept as pets (M. Marmontel pers. obs). Giant Otters are highly susceptible to persecution: they are large, conspicuous, social, and very vocal. They are active at daytime and occupy open habitats and stable territories. Their signs\u2014latrines and dens\u2014are easily recognizable, making it possible to identify areas of recent activity by a group (Groenendijk et al. 2005). Individuals and groups often react to people by approaching to investigate. Moreover, only the dominant pair produces young, and usually only once a year. During the pelt trade years, these life history attributes made them an easy target for fishermen. In 2017, a Giant Otter group was killed by fishermen in the Pantanal and according to locals, kills occur frequently during the fishing season (C. Leuchtenberger pers. obs.). In 2011\u20132012, the Kanamari indigenous people promoted a massive Giant Otter killing in their territory (Territ\u00f3rio Ind\u00edgena Kanamari), based on their perception that the species was overfishing the river turtle population. The community leader bought 300 cartridges for the hunters, who shot 64 Giant Otters (Endo pers. comm. 2012). Such incidents of targeted killing can lead to extinction of small populations in a watershed. Gold mining, artisanal as well as industrial, is a significant threat to the species, particularly in the Guiana Shield region, in southeastern Peru, the western region of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and northern Pantanal. The main impacts are habitat destruction, sedimentation of rivers, and pollution (Kimbrough 2014). Gold miners cut swathes into the floodplain forest and blast river banks with pressure hoses, using mercury to amalgamate gold particles. Gold prices are at a record high, whereas mercury is inexpensive. Forest conversion to mining increased six-fold from 2003\u20132006 to 2006\u20132009 (Swenson et al. 2011). Even a decade after mining stopped, areas affected still had depleted fish populations and had not been re-colonized by otters. In areas of gold mining, fish are contaminated with mercury. Gutleb et al. (1997) found that mercury concentrations in the majority of fish near Manu National Park were higher than considered tolerable for the Eurasian otter. Migration of contaminated fish and long-range atmospheric transport of mercury probably increase the area of influence of such contaminants. Contamination of otters by other heavy metals through pesticides and other agrochemicals is still poorly understood. The many planned hydroelectric dams in the species\u2019 range are a major threat to Giant Otters. These will alter hydrological regimes of rivers and affect fish populations and habitat (Latrubesse et al. 2017). Dams disrupt the annual cycles of inundations, vital for the maintenance of populations of flood dependent species such as the Giant Otter (Mour\u00e3o et al. 2010, Alho and Sabino 2011).

Decreases in the species's abundance are linked to land clearing that does not leave scattered trees in the landscape (Manning et al. 2007).

Scattered box-gum woodland is threatened by limited regeneration, rural tree dieback, removal of trees and firewood collection (Manning et al. 2007). In breeding areas the majority of nest trees are often on private land, with scattered paddock trees in mixed agricultural land of vital importance on the South-West Slopes. Nest-site fidelity means that birds continue to use traditional breeding sites despite habitat loss and degradation (Leslie 2005). Many nest trees are dead, particularly on inland slopes, and have no replacements when they fall or are cut for firewood, potentially resulting in competition with other species, particularly the Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris. There are limited provisions for the protection of dead trees, and due to continued illegal removal and natural loss of old trees a decline in nest site availability is inevitable (Manning et al. 2004). In areas of low occupancy, the availability of food in the breeding season, and not that of nest hollows, may limit population size (Leslie 2005). In the Riverina, altered flooding regimes may compromise the health and extent of riparian woodlands where this species nests (C. Tzaros and M. A. Weston in litt. 2003).

Pesticides, either directly or indirectly ingested, are also held responsible for local extinctions (Ziembicki and Woinarski 2007). The area where it has declined corresponds with the distribution of foxes in Australia, a distribution that may be slowly expanding northwards. Traditional and illegal hunting by people is also considerable and may be contributing to the perceived decline in northern and central Australia (Garnett and Crowley 2000). Across northern Australia it may be less common in areas invaded by woody weeds.

Declines on lands specifically protected for the species are largely the result of reduced habitat quality, caused by disrupted fire regimes (Breininger et al. 1999, 2006, 2009, 2010); suitable Florida Scrub-Jay habitat is thought to have declined by 22% between 1999-2012 (USFWS 2019). In addition, extensive habitat fragmentation has led to a high degree of genetic differentiation (Coulon et al. 2008) and additional land protection to increase connectivity within existing genetic units is likely necessary to prevent further fragmentation and loss of genetic diversity (Coulon et al. 2010, 2012). Reduced immigration into one of the largest remaining populations at Archbold Biological Station has resulted in increased levels of inbreeding and decreased fitness via inbreeding depression, emphasizing the importance of maintaining population connectivity (Chen et al. 2016 ). At Archbold, there is evidence of inbreeding depression at multiple life stages, including hatching failure, juvenile survival, and breeder lifespan (Chen et al. 2016). Housing developments and citrus-groves have replaced much suitable habitat (G. E. Woolfenden in litt. 1998). The rate of development in Florida has increased markedly since the 1960s as the human population almost doubled between 1960 and 1980 (Cox 1987). Direct human disturbance and feral cats affect the increasing number of territories adjacent to housing (Cox 1987), which can have the knock-on impact of reduced nesting success in suburban areas (see Niederhauser and Bowman 2014), and these individuals can also have reduced egg viability too (see Aldredge et al. 2012). Birds in roadside territories are frequently killed by vehicles (Dreschel et al. 1990, Mumme et al. 2000). Several species of snake, bird and mammal are native predators (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996). Nocturnal predators, including yellow rat snakes Elaphe obsoleta, are a particular threat since breeding birds do not appear to be vigilant to, or defend against, nocturnal predators and brooding females are also at risk from being killed (Carter et al. 2007). Hatching failure has been linked to below-average rainfall during the breeding season (Wilcoxen et al. 2011) and so droughts are likely to pose a threat to the species. The recent spread of West Nile virus to Florida may pose a threat to the species (Chu et al. 2003). An observation of nest-predation by invasive fire ants Solenopsis invicta was reported in south-central Florida in 2009 (Wilcoxen and Rensel 2009) and may be a threat to the reproductive success of the species. Climate change may pose a threat to the species through both increased drought and hurricane frequency and intensity, and sea level rise (USFWS 2019).\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 8.1.2 Named species (Paspalum notatum). \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 8, Name: 'Invasive & Other Problematic Species, Genes & Diseases', Description: 'Threats from non-native and native plants, animals, pathogens/microbes, or genetic materials that have or are predicted to have harmful effects on biodiversity following their introduction, spread and/or increase in abundance.'\nCode: 8.1, Name: 'Invasive Non-Native/Alien Species/Diseases', Description: 'Harmful plants, animals, pathogens, and other microbes not originally found within the ecosystem(s) in question and directly or indirectly introduced and spread into it by human activities.'\nCode: 8.1.2, Name: 'Named Species', Description: 'List the specific plant, animal, or microbe e.g., feral domesticated cattle, household pets, zebra mussels, Dutch elm disease or chestnut blight, Miconia tree, introduction of species for biocontrol, chytrid fungus affecting amphibians, etc.'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

Decreases in the species's abundance are linked to land clearing that does not leave scattered trees in the landscape (Manning et al. 2007). Remaining habitat is often fragmented, with feeding and breeding habitats divided. Regeneration is commonly prevented by high grazing levels by stock and rabbits or inappropriate fire regimes. Scattered box-gum woodland is threatened by limited regeneration, rural tree dieback, removal of trees and firewood collection (Manning et al. 2007). In breeding areas the majority of nest trees are often on private land, with scattered paddock trees in mixed agricultural land of vital importance on the South-West Slopes. Nest-site fidelity means that birds continue to use traditional breeding sites despite habitat loss and degradation (Leslie 2005). Many nest trees are dead, particularly on inland slopes, and have no replacements when they fall or are cut for firewood, potentially resulting in competition with other species, particularly the Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris. There are limited provisions for the protection of dead trees, and due to continued illegal removal and natural loss of old trees a decline in nest site availability is inevitable (Manning et al. 2004). In areas of low occupancy, the availability of food in the breeding season, and not that of nest hollows, may limit population size (Leslie 2005). In the Riverina, altered flooding regimes may compromise the health and extent of riparian woodlands where this species nests (C. Tzaros and M. A. Weston in litt. 2003).

In rural areas, direct persecution in retaliation for or prevention of predation on lambs is also common, even where hunting is officially illegal and despite the true economic impact of predation being unquantified (Lucherini and Luengos Vidal 2008, M. Lucherini pers. obs. 2015).Most of the species' range has suffered massive habitat alteration. For instance, the Pampas, which represents a large proportion of the species' distribution range, has been affected by extensive cattle breeding and agriculture. Approximately 0.1% of the original 500,000 km\u00b2 range remains unaffected. However, due to the species' adaptability, the Pampas Fox seems able to withstand the loss and degradation of its natural habitat, as well as hunting pressure. Since no studies are available on its population dynamics in rural ecosystems, caution is required, since the sum of these threats may eventually promote the depletion of fox populations.

Hall in litt. 2000, Otieno et al. 2010, C. Kendall in litt. 2012). Several Lappet-faced Vultures were found to have died after feeding on the carcass of a poisoned jackal in Namibia (Komen 2009) and two birds were killed as a result of feeding on a poisoned carcass in Kenya (Kendall and Virani 2012). A mass poisoning event involving at least 15 Lappet-faced Vultures occurred in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe in 2012 (Groom et al. 2012), while another in Botswana in 2019 resulted in the death of 14 Lappet-faced Vultures (BirdGuides 2019). The upper beaks of eight of these birds were removed suggesting that they may be traded for traditional medicine. It is also often mistakenly persecuted as a livestock predator (Brown 1986): one major deliberate poisoning incident killed 86 individuals in Namibia (Simmons 1995). Other major threats to the species include nest predation by humans, reduced food availability (including the replacement of the traditional \"Dabokka\" movement of camels with cargo tracks [H. Ibrahim in litt. 2016]) and electrocution (Shimelis et al. 2005). Increasing use of agricultural pesticides may also be a problem for the species (Mundy et al. 1992), including those breeding at Tayma, Saudi Arabia (Shimelis et al. 2005). Nest disturbance, to which it is extremely sensitive (Steyn 1982), may be growing with an increase in forest settlements in Ethiopia (A. Shimelis in litt. 2007) and the increasing recreational use of off-road vehicles (Mundy et al. 1992). In Saudi Arabia, suitable nesting trees may be subject to the most intense human disturbance as shepherds also use the same large trees for shelter for themselves and their livestock (Shobrak 2011). Breeding birds at Tayma could face disturbance from motorised vehicles in the desert (Shimelis et al. 2005). Nest trees are also susceptible to fire and are often pushed over by elephants (Murn and Botha in prep.), although tree availability is not thought to be a limiting factor for the species (Kendall et al. 2017).The population collapse in West Africa may be a result of higher nest disturbance, local extinctions of wild ungulates through habitat modification and over-hunting, intensified cattle farming in which sick or dying animals are rarely abandoned, and an increase in accidental poisoning (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004, Thiollay 2006), although the latter threat, in particular, requires further study (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). National vaccination campaigns in West Africa have reduced illness in domestic livestock, and sick animals can now be sold off, rather than abandoned, due to the proliferation of markets and abattoirs (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). The species may be hunted for medicine and cultural reasons in West Africa, and some ethnic groups in the sub-region hunt vultures for food, though the impact on this species is unknown (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). It is also thought to be used for traditional medicine in South Africa, with all vultures having the potential for traditional medicine use in southern Africa (McKean et al. 2013, W. Goodwin in litt. 2016) and has been recorded in trade in West and Central African markets (Buij et al. 2016). With 858-1,284 individuals reported to have been traded over a six year period in West Africa, numbers traded represent a potentially significant proportion of the regional population.In central Mozambique, the population has declined due to a scarcity of game and livestock following the armed conflict of the 1970s and 1980s, and the surviving population continues to be threatened by the over-exploitation of game by poachers (Parker 2005). There are incidences of deliberate poisoning by poachers, due to the belief that the arriving vultures will give away the locations of poached animals (Hancock 2009, Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada et al. 2015). In Ethiopia, the principal threat to the species is habitat loss on the lowland plains (A. Shimelis in litt. 2007, 2012).

In pastoral areas, pastures have been agriculturally improved and areas of low, herb-rich scrub converted to grassland and further habitat loss has occurred through the loss of arable farming from open hill areas, if livestock are removed (leading to encroachment of tall scrub and forest) (Tucker and Heath 1994). Urbanization and agricultural expansion have also caused habitat fragmentation. Over-hunting is likely to have played a role in the decline of the species: over 60% of estimated potential population may be shot each year (McGowan and Kirwan 2013).The species status as a gamebird of high socioeconomic value means that there is a considerable effort to maintain a huntable surplus, which is eminently achievable with good habitat management: there is some evidence that hunting mortality is compensatory to natural mortality (Soucher et al. 2018). One approach to achieving this has been to release captive-reared birds shortly prior to the hunting season, a practice that increased rapidly from the end of the 20th century (Casas et al. 2016) and upwards of 3-6 million farm-bred partridges are now released annually (D\u00edaz\u2010Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2012). Ensuring hunting bag limits are sustainable is dependent on an accurate assessment of abundance prior to the season, but it was found that in intensive estates where large numbers of birds are released, harvest depended only on release intensity (D\u00edaz\u2010Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2012). The presence of released birds can also increases estimates from field assessments of abundance, but as their survival rate is very low (&lt;0.05 to the next spring: [Souchay et al. 2018]) this adjustment results in larger numbers of 'wild' individuals (birds that have bred) being taken (Casas et al. 2016).The actual stock that is released is also a threat: 63% of farmed birds had mtDNA lineages from Chukar (A. chukar), but more alarmingly so did 45% of wild Red-legged Partridges (Blanco-Aguiar et al. 2008), potentially undermining the genetic distinctiveness of the species.

Hunting for the pelt trade was the greatest threat to the Giant Otter in the past and the species came close to extinction in the early 1970s in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazilian Pantanal (Duplaix 1980). From 1960 to 1969, records indicated a regional harvest of 12,390 giant otter skins. In 1973, giant otters were placed on CITES Appendix I, and the enforcement of international trade restrictions on Giant Otter skins in 1975 finally ended Giant Otter hunting (Recharte and Bodmer 2010). The Giant Otter remains endangered because of the low recuperation rate of relict populations now also under pressure from human activities (Groenendijk et al. 2015). Direct conflict between humans and otters is an increasing problem. Otters may be killed for fun or out of fear, or, more often, because they are seen as competitors for fish by loggers, miners, and fishermen, who often blame them for depleting fish resources used for local and commercial consumption (G\u00f3mez and Jorgensen 1999, Recharte et al. 2008, Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2012, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Giant Otters can drown in fishing nets and traps and are also blamed for damaging them (Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2012, Utreras et al. 2013). Fish farming is rapidly increasing in the species\u2019 range, for example in parts of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and expose otters to retaliation killing (V. Utreras pers. obs.). Cubs are sometimes captured illegally to be kept as pets (M. Marmontel pers. obs). Giant Otters are highly susceptible to persecution: they are large, conspicuous, social, and very vocal. They are active at daytime and occupy open habitats and stable territories. Their signs\u2014latrines and dens\u2014are easily recognizable, making it possible to identify areas of recent activity by a group (Groenendijk et al. 2005). Individuals and groups often react to people by approaching to investigate. Moreover, only the dominant pair produces young, and usually only once a year. During the pelt trade years, these life history attributes made them an easy target for fishermen. In 2017, a Giant Otter group was killed by fishermen in the Pantanal and according to locals, kills occur frequently during the fishing season (C. Leuchtenberger pers. obs.). In 2011\u20132012, the Kanamari indigenous people promoted a massive Giant Otter killing in their territory (Territ\u00f3rio Ind\u00edgena Kanamari), based on their perception that the species was overfishing the river turtle population. The community leader bought 300 cartridges for the hunters, who shot 64 Giant Otters (Endo pers. comm. 2012). Such incidents of targeted killing can lead to extinction of small populations in a watershed. Gold mining, artisanal as well as industrial, is a significant threat to the species, particularly in the Guiana Shield region, in southeastern Peru, the western region of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and northern Pantanal. The main impacts are habitat destruction, sedimentation of rivers, and pollution (Kimbrough 2014). Gold miners cut swathes into the floodplain forest and blast river banks with pressure hoses, using mercury to amalgamate gold particles. Gold prices are at a record high, whereas mercury is inexpensive. Forest conversion to mining increased six-fold from 2003\u20132006 to 2006\u20132009 (Swenson et al. 2011). Even a decade after mining stopped, areas affected still had depleted fish populations and had not been re-colonized by otters. In areas of gold mining, fish are contaminated with mercury. Gutleb et al. (1997) found that mercury concentrations in the majority of fish near Manu National Park were higher than considered tolerable for the Eurasian otter. Migration of contaminated fish and long-range atmospheric transport of mercury probably increase the area of influence of such contaminants. Contamination of otters by other heavy metals through pesticides and other agrochemicals is still poorly understood. The many planned hydroelectric dams in the species\u2019 range are a major threat to Giant Otters. These will alter hydrological regimes of rivers and affect fish populations and habitat (Latrubesse et al. 2017). Dams disrupt the annual cycles of inundations, vital for the maintenance of populations of flood dependent species such as the Giant Otter (Mour\u00e3o et al. 2010, Alho and Sabino 2011). One hundred and eighty-four new dams are planned or under construction, greater than two MW capacity over the next 20 years in the Amazon. These dams would include five of the six major Andean tributaries of the Amazon. Sixty per cent of the dams would cause the first major break in connectivity between protected Andean headwaters and the lowland Amazon. Giant Otters are able to live in some artificial lakes, such as the shallow Balbina Reservoir in Brazil (Rosas et al. 2007). In other areas, hydroelectric dams have depleted Giant Otter populations, as did the Curu\u00e1-Una Hydroelectric in the Brazilian Amazonia (Rosas et al. 2007). Around the Pantanal, there are over 115 projects of small hydroelectric plants. Other major infrastructure projects include the Inter-oceanic highway in southeastern Peru, and the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America (V. Utreras pers. comm. 2012). Giant Otters are vulnerable to disturbance from poorly managed tourism, including sport fishing. It is important to control increasing levels of tourism on lakes and rivers both in and outside protected areas (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Research has shown that Giant Otter reproductive success and sighting success by tourists is considerably lower on unmanaged lakes than on managed lakes (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Giant Otter cubs held in captivity have died of canine parvovirus, and all mustelids are susceptible to canine distemper, so domestic animal diseases may pose a serious threat to wild Giant Otter populations. Infection can also occur in remote areas, since transient otters and people hunting with dogs travel large distances with potential for contact and infection of vulnerable otter populations (Schenck et al. 1999). Climatic changes are predicted to increase suitable areas for Giant Otters (Cianfrani et al. 2018). However, long-term habitat and climatic modifications will increase the exposure of suitable core otter areas to the negative effects of the surrounding unsuitable areas (Cianfrani et al. 2018). The species also has a high specialized niche, making it more vulnerable to climate change.\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 5.1.2 Unintentional effects (species is not the target). \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 5, Name: 'Biological Resource Use', Description: 'Threats from consumptive use of 'wild' biological resources including both deliberate and unintentional harvesting effects; also persecution or control of specific species.'\nCode: 5.1, Name: 'Hunting & Collecting Terrestrial Animals', Description: 'Killing or trapping terrestrial wild animals or animal products for commercial, recreation, subsistence, research, or cultural purposess, or for control/persecution reasons; includes accidental mortality/bycatch.'\nCode: 5.1.2, Name: 'Unintentional Effects (species being assessed is not the target)', Examples: 'pest control often impacts non-targeted species, hunter's dogs may chase after and kill other non-target species during a hunt, loss of a species' prey base due to over-harvesting by humans of their prey, etc.'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

Historically, there has been an extensive modification of old-growth pine forests for timber and woodpulp. In the Sierra Madre Occidental, 80-85% of forest cover remains, but only 0.6% is old-growth (Lammertink et al. 1996). In 1994, there was extensive penetration and degradation of habitat in south Chihuahua by drug-growers, loggers and huge numbers of cattle. In the same year, forest stands at Mesa de Guacamayas were heavily burned (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). Logging has been intensive in the Sierra Madre Occidental, with no large fragments of old growth forest remaining in northern areas (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). Commercial logging in the area involves the removal of larger trees and standing dead wood, and appears to reduce nest-site availability by leaving few snags and pine trees large enough for the species to nest in. Such large-scale logging operations across the species's historic range may be responsible for its decline (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). As a result of habitat loss, the breeding strongholds are now concentrated in two areas; Cebadillas de Yahuirachi and Madera (Monterrubio-Rico et al. 2006). Fire remains a serious threat to the species (M. A. Cruz-Nieto et al. in litt. 2007). Illegal trade in the species has fluctuated with peaks in the early 1970s and mid-1980s. Unofficial records confirm that the species is taken for illegal trade, but the extent of trapping is not known (M. A. Cruz-Nieto et al. in litt. 2007).

However, some populations are under local pressure from agriculture and development projects. Although not well documented, they are hunted for bushmeat in some areas (Wallis pers. obs. Tanzania 1991, Wallis pers. obs. in Nigeria 2006\u20132008, van Vliet et al. 2012). The potential for increased hunting pressure should be monitored. With rising numbers in the human population and declining numbers of other wildlife species, Olive Baboons may eventually become a more sought-after target; at 30 kg, an adult male provides a substantial source of protein. It should be noted that Olive Baboons have been found to harbour Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses (SIV) (Peeters et al. 2002) and Ebola virus (Leroy et al. 2004), thus highlighting the health risks of baboon meat consumption to humans. Both Papio anubis and P. cynocephalus are naturally infected with Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue, the bacterium that causes human yaws and closely related to the bacterium that causes syphilis (T. p. pallidum) (see Harper et al. 2012, Chuma et al. 2019). In Papio sp., the infection appears to spread through sexual contact and is associated with open lesions in and around the genitalia of both sexes. The degree of morbidity varies, including some cases of deaths occurring in the Tanzania\u2019s Gombe National Park\u2019s Olive Baboons, when the genitalia are so badly damaged that urinary flow was obstructed (Wallis and Lee 1999). Similar lesions appear in some other Olive Baboon populations throughout their range, most notably in Lake Manyara National Park in Tanzania (Chuma et al. 2019) and Yankari Game Reserve in Nigeria (Wallis pers. obs. 2007).

Simmons in litt. 2007). Habitat is primarily lost to agriculture, and this is compounded by the uncontrolled burning of fynbos and grassland, which renders these habitats unsuitable for breeding for about five years (R.E. Simmons, O. Curtis and A. Jenkins in litt. 2004). Alien vegetation and urbanisation are also cited as causes of habitat loss (Curtis et al. 2004). In south-western South Africa, it is thought that breeding birds have been displaced from prime lowland habitats (renosterveld and fynbos) by the spread of cereal agriculture, with breeding pairs presently occupying only coastal areas, with high productivity, and montane habitats, where breeding success is low and levels of nest predation are high (Curtis et al. 2004). It is particularly vulnerable to nest predation because it nests on the ground (see Lee and Simmons 2014). Rodent populations in areas of wheat cultivation may be as low as 33% of those found in renosterveld vegetation (R.E. Simmons in litt. 2004), and remnant patches of renosterveld, which continue to be degraded (R.E. Simmons, O. Curtis and A. Jenkins in litt. 2004), hold lower numbers of rodents than coastal strandveld vegetation (R.E. Simmons in litt. 2004). Low hatching rates, possibly as a result of high pesticide residues, is an increasing threat now that many remaining breeding habitats are surrounded by agricultural areas (R.E. Simmons, O. Curtis and A. Jenkins in litt. 2004). The ingestion of herbicides and pesticides may account for the death of some adults in South Africa (Simmons 2005). Persistent organocholorines, which were found in blood samples from South African birds, may cause physical stress and reduced immunity at higher blood concentrations (Garcia-Heras et al. 2017b). Road deaths adjacent to west coast breeding grounds also numbered six birds over one breeding season in 2007 (R.E. Simmons in litt. 2007). Drainage, impoundment and inappropriate management of vleis, marshes or streams near breeding grounds could prove detrimental. Climate change in South Africa is predicted to cause a decrease in overall winter rainfall in the core breeding areas, which is likely to lead to a reduction in mouse populations and disruption to breeding (R.E. Simmons in litt. 2007). The same threats may apply to the species in Namibia, and the favoured habitats of the migrant population may be overgrazed, particularly in southern Namibia (Simmons 2005). Overgrazing in southern Namibia is attributed mainly to resident pastoralists and 'emergency grazing' by farmers from elsewhere, which is offered during years of good rainfall (R.E. Simmons in litt. 2007). Assessments carried out between 2016-2019 found wind farms to be a major threat to Black Harriers, with a mortality rate of 1.5 birds per year at some farms (R.E Simmons, 2019, pers. comm.,). Initial results from a PVA underway by Cervantes et al., (in prep) suggest that if an average of three birds were killed per year by wind farms in South Africa the population would collapse in about 100 years, while if five birds were killed per year by wind farms in South Africa the population would collapse in less than 75 years.\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 2.1.3 Agro-industry farming. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 2, Name: 'Agriculture & Aquaculture', Description: 'Threats from farming and ranching as a result of agricultural expansion and intensification, including silviculture, mariculture and aquaculture (includes the impacts of any fencing around farmed areas)'\nCode: 2.1, Name: 'Annual & Perennial Non-Timber Crops', Description: 'Crops planted for food, fodder, fibre, fuel, or other uses.'\nCode: 2.1.3, Name: 'Agro-industry Farming'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

From 1967 to 2000, the area under oil palm cultivation here increased from less than 2000 km\u00b2 to more than 30,000 km\u00b2. In 2011, 83,000 km\u00b2 were planted with oil palm, including 20,000 km\u00b2 in Peninsular Malaysia, 24,000 km\u00b2 on Borneo, and 39,000 km\u00b2 in Sumatra (Koh et al. 2011). In 2013, this number had grown to 116,000 km\u00b2 (71,000 km\u00b2 in Indonesia and 45,000 km\u00b2 in Malaysia; Vijay et al. 2016), and the area planted with oil palm continues to increase rapidly (Meijaard and Sheil 2013). The establishment of oil palm monocultures does not only lead to loss of biodiversity but also contributes to habitat fragmentation and environmental pollution through chemical fertilizers or pesticide runoffs (reviewed in Fitzherbert et al. 2008), which directly affects M. nemestrina, who frequently uses plantations for short foraging bouts (Holzner et al. 2019, 2021a), and may thus get in direct and prolonged contact with dangerous chemicals, such as paraquat, which is a reportedly harmful herbicide (CDC 2018) still commonly used in Peninsular Malaysia (N. Ruppert, pers. obs.).During the past decade, Malaysia alone has lost 11.3% of its primary forest and 16.8% of tree cover (Mongabay, 2021) and Macaca nemestrina is reported to be sensitive to timber harvest (Meijaard et al. 2007), and has experienced a 10% decline in local site occupancy in heavily disturbed and clear-cut forest sites over a period of only four years, recently (2013-2017; Holzner et al. 2021b).Human-wildlife conflict and a generally negative public perception of this species is quite severe. Macaca nemestrina has consistently been in the Top-5 list of public complaints about wildlife filed to the Department of Wildlife and National Parks Peninsular Malaysia (mean 298 annual complaints between 2013\u20132018 for Peninsular Malaysia alone; DWNP 2018). Negative public perceptions also occur due to crop foraging, which results in the macaques being perceived as pests. A study on crop foraging by Linkie et al. (2007) in Sumatra found that M. nemestrina was one of the most frequently reported crop foragers for rice, banana and papaya here. However, in Peninsular Malaysia, it was shown that M. nemestrina frequently forages in oil palm plantations but causes little damage to ripe oil palm fruits (&lt;0.6%); it instead contributes to increasing oil palm yield by foraging on pest rodents in plantations (Holzner et al. 2019). However, due to the high infant mortality, palm oil plantations are not suitable habitats for the species, and it needs healthy forest adjacent to the plantations. Also, the publication by Holzner et al.

For example, if hunting (i.e., threat code 5.1.1) is identified as a threat within one particular region only, the severity is scored as the % rate of decline to the population within that region only.\n\nThe threat description from IUCN is \"By mid-2000, Gyps vultures were being found dead and dying in Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported (Prakash et al. 2003, 2007, Gilbert et al. 2006). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality. Vultures are exposed to diclofenac and other NSAIDs through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that had been treated prior to death (often as part of palliative care) and left for scavengers to consume. Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs which then cause renal failure resulting in visceral gout in the vast majority of examined vultures (Oaks et al. 2004a, Shultz et al. 2004, Green et al. 2004, Swan et al. 2006b, Gilbert et al. 2006, Cuthbert et al. 2014). Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in Gyps vultures, just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues (Green et al. 2004); and sampling carcasses of livestock in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart et al. 2009). Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality and diclofenac being banned in several range states, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations (Paudel 2008), potentially leading to a slower uptake of meloxicam, an alternative veterinary drug that is of low toxicity to vultures and which has been promoted as a safe alternative to diclofenac in the region (Swan et al. 2006a, Swarup et al. 2007). Additionally, large vials of diclofenac continue to be manufactured for human use, which are then distributed, sold and used for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert et al. 2011, T. Galligan in litt. 2016). A second veterinary drug in use in India and particularly in Bangladesh, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that they are present in sufficient concentrations to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo et al. 2010). Additionally, aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac, which is converted to diclofenac in cattle (Galligan et al. 2016), and is therefore as toxic to vultures as diclofenac itself. Wild vultures have also been found dead in India with visceral gout and residues of the veterinary NSAID nimesulide in their tissues (Cuthbert et al. 2016; Nambirajan et al. in prep. 2021). This combination has only been found previously for gout and diclofenac, and therefore provides a strong indication that nimesulide is also toxic to vultures (C. Bowden in litt. 2016). The availability of other NSAIDs, including ketoprofen and nimesulide, is increasing (Cuthbert et al. 2011b, Khan 2013, C. Bowden in litt. 2016). Flunixin is another NSAID that has been associated with visceral gout in vultures (Zorrilla et al. 2015), though it is not commonly in use in South Asia yet (T. Galligan in litt. 2016). One study recorded that the sex of fledglings, the sex of dead adults and the sex of adults with visceral gout were all male-biased which may lead to problems in the future (Arshad et al. 2009).Other likely contributory factors in South Asia are changes in human consumption and processing of dead livestock (which have occurred in response to the collapse in vulture numbers) and poison and pesticide use, but these are probably of more minor significance (C. Bowden in litt. 2016). In Bangladesh, 61% of cattle owners surveyed said that they now buried dead cattle or used them as food in shrimp farms, which could lead to a reduction in food supply for vultures (Khan 2013). Forest fires may also be a threat in some areas, for instance in the Himalayas, though this may need further study (M. Thakur in litt. 2016). Deforestation, electrocution and collision with energy infrastructure may pose additional threats in some parts of the range (Botha et al. 2017).In South-East Asia, the near-total disappearance of the species pre-dated the present crisis, and probably resulted from the collapse of large wild ungulate populations and improved management of deceased livestock reducing food availability (Clements et al. 2013). In Cambodia, vultures are still threatened by extremely low population densities of wild ungulates, a decline in the number of free-ranging domestic ungulates, felling of nesting trees for timber and accidental poisoning at carcasses laced with pesticides to kill stray dogs and for hunting wildlife (Loveridge et al. 2019; Clements et al. 2013; S. Mahood in litt. 2012). Loveridge et al (2019) recorded 15 vulture poisoning events in Cambodia during 2005-2016, resulting in the known deaths of 32 White-rumped Vultures. The same study also recorded the first confirmed vulture mortality from carbofuran in Cambodia. Additional threats identified in Myanmar include direct persecution of the species through nest destruction, hunting and poisoning and indirectly through a loss of food supply (Hla et al. 2011).\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 12.1 Other threat. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 12, Name: 'Other Options', Description: 'The threats classification scheme is intended to be comprehensive, but as there are often new and emerging threats, this option allows for these new threats to be recorded.'\nCode: 12.1, Name: 'Other Threat', Description: 'State the specific problem/s.'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

The excessive burning of grasslands may suppress populations of prey species, whilst the intensive grazing of livestock is also probably degrading otherwise suitable habitat (Baker et al. 2011). The Grassland Biome in South Africa is threatened by the expansion of woody vegetation, which would translate to direct habitat loss and a possible reduction in foraging efficacy (Colyn et al., 2020, in review). In Kenya, suitable habitat is being converted to other land uses, particularly for commercial purposes (B. Amakobe in litt. 2020). Disturbance by humans, probably most often herders, is likely to negatively affect breeding. The species is captured and traded in apparently small numbers; however, it is unknown how many die in captivity and transit. Direct hunting and nest-raiding for other uses and indiscriminate poisoning at waterholes are also potential threats. Exposure to secondary pesticide poisoning is a concern, and birds are also susceptible to negative impacts from collisions with fence lines and electric cables (Whitecross et al. 2019). 94 power-line fatalities have been recorded in 20 years by the Endangered Wildlife Trust (A. Botha in litt. 2020). Large ranging behaviour outside of protected areas increases their risk of injury and fatality (Whitecross et al. 2019).

Observations in the last decade or so have confirmed that individuals occasionally attack the soft body parts of juvenile domestic cattle (N. Rios per R. Wallace 2004, H. Vargas and F. S\u00e1enz pers. obs. per R. Wallace in litt. 2020). Intensive observations in the field show that this appears to be an extremely rare event that represents less than 1% of the mortalities of livestock (Ballejo et al. 2020). In addition, the persecution of mountain lions and foxes through the illegal poisoning of carcasses is seriously affecting the species in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and probably Bolivia (Pavez and Estades 2016, Alarc\u00f3n and Lambertucci 2018, Pauli et al. 2018, Piana 2019, Estrada Pacheco et al. 2020, F. S\u00e1enz and D. M\u00e9ndez per R. Wallace in litt. 2020, G. Wiemeyer in litt. 2020). This threat is increasing in intensity. By early 2020, species experts had systematized 225 individuals across the range, with about 50% of recorded cases resulting in mortality, although this percentage is biased by rescue centre animals and mortality rates are likely higher, as many dead poisoning victims are almost certainly not detected or reported across the range.The species is highly dependent on the carcasses of exotic herbivores in Argentina, which form 98.5% of their diet, making them vulnerable to changes in livestock raising and to the consumption of hunting ammunition (Lambertucci et al. 2009). Interspecific competition for carcasses with American Black Vulture Coragyps atratus, which have recently begun to occupy the same areas, may have a deleterious effect on Andean Condor populations (Carrete et al. 2010, Ballejo et al. 2018). Similarly, a number of studies have revealed the significance of other threats to the species including lead poisoning (Lambertucci et al. 2011, Wiemeyer et al. 2017, Plaza et al. 2020), illegal use in folkloric events (Piana 2014, 2019), illegal wildlife trade (Williams et al. 2011), use as pets (Pavez and Estades 2016), collisions with electrical and telecommunication infrastructure (S.

Surveys revealed that Sugar Gliders predated nests and the probability of a nest surviving the 60-day nesting period when Sugar Gliders were present was 0.17 (Stojanovic et al. 2014). On mainland Tasmania almost 79% nests were predated and 65% of adult females were killed by Sugar Gliders. Predation was most severe in locations with low forest cover. Owing to the fact that Swift Parrot breeding distribution varies widely between years the extent of nest predation is also expected to vary annually depending on the distribution of Sugar Gliders and forest cover. Sugar Gliders have not been reported from Bruny Island, a Swift Parrot breeding site.Habitat loss and alteration within breeding and drought refuge habitats remains a key threat. In Tasmania, breeding habitat is significantly reduced and fragmented through clearance of E. globulus for agriculture, residential development, plantation timber, sawlog production and clear-felling for woodchips. In 2017, a large area of key nesting habitat has been logged for timber extraction (D. Stojanovic in litt. 2017). Over 50% of the original grassy E. globulus forest in Tasmania has been cleared (Brereton et al. 2004). Selective logging has resulted in the removal of larger trees from the remaining forest patches. Such patches are typically unfenced and exhibit poor regeneration (Brereton et al. 2004). Competition for remaining nest-sites with Common Starlings Sturnus vulgaris could be a problem along forest edges. Even with protection of remaining habitat (80% private land), maintenance and recovery may be limited by the dependence of breeding on an irregular nectar supply. It also suffers high mortality through collision with windows, vehicles and fences. On the mainland, clearance and degradation of habitat for agriculture, forestry and residential and commercial development has had the biggest impact (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). Much of the preferred lowland habitat on the most fertile and productive sites has been cleared or substantially modified (C. Tzaros in litt. 2003). Drought refuge habitats continue to be cleared and fragmented for coastal developments (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). Remnants, including much of what currently exists in the conservation reserve system, have been heavily cut-over and degraded, and this practice is continuing in many areas, including hardwood production forests. This practice is considered to result in poor and unreliable nectar-sources through the reduction of large mature trees. Competition from large nectarivores honeyeaters and the introduced Bumblebee Bombus terrestris may be exacerbated by forest fragmentation. In winter, the species relies heavily on public land that has been exploited for timber, honey and minerals (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005). Global warming threatens to alter habitat phenology and climatic conditions such that habitat availability may be significantly reduced (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). The species is also threatened by disturbance, Psittacine beak and feather disease and illegal bird capture and trade (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). Furthermore, the species seems to be very susceptible to Allee effects, where survival and reproductive success decline with decreasing population density, which might even accelerate the population decline (Crates et al. 2017).\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 8.5 Viral/prion-induced diseases. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 8, Name: 'Invasive & Other Problematic Species, Genes & Diseases', Description: 'Threats from non-native and native plants, animals, pathogens/microbes, or genetic materials that have or are predicted to have harmful effects on biodiversity following their introduction, spread and/or increase in abundance.'\nCode: 8.5, Name: 'Viral/Prion-induced Diseases', Description: 'Viruses are small infectious agents that replicate only inside the living cells of an organism.

According to the Technical Meeting of the Vicu\u00f1a Convention (2015) there has been, with the exception of Ecuador, an alarming increase in Vicu\u00f1a poaching throughout its range, especially affecting isolated Chilean and relict populations whose marginal distribution increases their vulnerability. Among the factors that facilitate poaching of Vicu\u00f1as in the high Andes are (SACSG, 2014): 1) The wide geographic range of Vicu\u00f1a populations and the extensive long frontier areas among the countries involved; 2) The geographic characteristics of the area, with low Vicu\u00f1a population densities and a high degree of isolation; 3) Lack of human and technical resources devoted to protection of the species in the host countries; 4) High value of the fibre and Vicu\u00f1a products in the international market; 5) Existence of a substantial market for illegal fibre and handcrafts at the local level; 6) Lack of effective punishment for illegal hunters; 7) Insufficient confiscation of illegal products; 8) Limited coordinated security forces within and between countries; 9) Limited benefits to local communities, and sometimes insufficient support and incentives to develop legal Vicu\u00f1a use, resulting in greater benefits from illegal than from legal uses. Thus, it is considered of particular relevance that the following measures to be promoted:A) On cooperation among Andean countries:1. Intensification of inter-boundary cooperation among neighbouring countries, including security forces, for the control of international frontiers to optimize efforts to eliminate illegal traffic.2. Critical revision of the compliance with previous agreements and documents, developed during Technical Meetings of the Vicu\u00f1a Convention on Vicu\u00f1a poaching and trafficking.3. Standardized registry in the five countries of legally obtained fibre, its processing, imports and exports, in order to be able to monitor its commercialization.B) At the national level:1. Information dissemination regarding legal sanctions and the updating of national, regional, and local laws to make them more effective against poaching and illegal commercialization of Vicu\u00f1a fibre and products.2. Facilitation and support of local Andean communities in the development of technical and organizational capacities to harvest fibre from their Vicu\u00f1as under strict animal welfare protocols and strengthening local community organizations.3. Governmental support to local Andean communities in the commercialization and value-added processes of legal fibre, simplifying the process and strengthening the stages of the legal chain of commercialization.4. Supply of sufficient legal fibre for local artisan use at subsidized prices, to minimize use of illegal fibre and increasing value added processes in the countries of origin.5. Reinforcing and implementation at the national level of schemes of supervision, legal oversight, and tracing origins of the fibre, from shearing to its conclusion on the supply chain (shearing, storage, transformation, commercialization, and export).6. Permanent training of police, judicial and customs authorities, with respect to legislation and other subjects related to production and movement of fibre, as well as identification of camelid fibres and their sub-products.7. The intensification of seizures of illegal clothing and the implementation of sanctions to those involved in purchasing or selling them.8. Implementation of informative and awareness campaigns, especially at touristic sites and airports, alerting tourists of the requirements to be met by legal Vicu\u00f1a fibre products.C) On the cooperation between exporting and importing countries:1. Strengthening of local cooperation networks and swifter communication between CITES authorities and importing and exporting countries.2. Development and collaboration in the implementation of systems to trace the origin of Vicu\u00f1a products and sub-products, to be implemented internationally.3. The strengthening of controls in the importing countries regarding the processing and marketing Vicu\u00f1a products and sub-products.Despite the fact that participating countries are moving forward in the development of National Management and Conservation plans since the last Vicu\u00f1a assessment (2008), as well as the provision of guidelines for sustainable management and animal welfare criteria, the lack of specific budgets or poor funding hinder achievement of conservation and management actions. Recent studies have shown that capture, handling, live-shearing and releasing wild Vicu\u00f1as under strict sustainable management and welfare protocols (although showing subtle and transitory behavioural and social structure changes after being released) does not compromise the conservation or maintenance of ecologically functional wild populations (Sahley et al. 2007, Arzamendia and Vil\u00e1 2012, Marcoppido et al. 2017). Among the two widely used methods for capturing Vicu\u00f1as, the traditional \u2018Chaku\u2019 (surround-capture by people on foot) results in less stress on animals than the use of motor vehicles to chase the animals (Sarno et al. 2009, Arzamendia et al. 2010). On the other hand, captive management has proven to have no contribution to Vicu\u00f1a conservation (Lichtenstein 2006). Vicu\u00f1as, domestic camelids and introduced livestock have similar foraging preferences and share Andean habitats. As a result, local people perceive Vicu\u00f1as as a competitive species, and do not tolerate their presence (Lichtenstein and Renaudeau d'Arc 2004). This is especially worrisome around wetland (bofedales) habitats which are critical for Vicu\u00f1as (Koford 1957, Renaudeau d'Arc et al. 2000, Mosca Torres and Puig 2012, Mosca Torres et al. 2015) and locally shared with domestic animals (Borgnia et al. 2008, Wurstten et al. 2014, Arzamendia and Vil\u00e1 2015, McLaren et al. 2018). Vicu\u00f1as are frequently displaced by livestock, from the high-quality habitats to sub-optimal low-productivity habitats (Borgnia et al. 2008), where they still are able to persist. Further, the presence of herders with dogs represents an important stress factor for Vicu\u00f1as (Arzamendia and Vil\u00e1 2015). Habitat loss triggered by livestock over-grazing, and habitat fragmentation due to industrial and rural sprawl, and the development of large-scale mining projects may jeopardize the viability of Vicu\u00f1a populations located beyond protected areas. Mining activities directly impact Vicu\u00f1a populations by occupying preferred habitats and as a result of road kills due to high traffic levels, heavy machinery employed etc., and indirectly through the extraction and pollution of water resources (Mata et al. 2016).Climate change will probably have a detrimental impact in the fragile ecosystems where Vicu\u00f1as occur since they are at the limits of habitable environments. Therefore, the assessment of the potential effects of climate change on Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s habitats is a priority.Epidemiological studies on Vicu\u00f1a wild populations in Bolivia, Per\u00fa and Argentina that share spatial and forage resources with domestic camelids and livestock do not show prevalence levels of endo- or ectoparasites that seem to be a problem for the viability of their populations (Ch\u00e1vez-Vel\u00e1squez et al. 2005, Beltr\u00e1n-Saavedra et al. 2011, Arzamendia et al. 2012, Marcoppido et al. 2016). However, a growing concern is emerging since some Vicu\u00f1a populations throughout their distribution are suffering from mange caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. For example, two important protected areas for the species\u2019 conservation are showing a high incidence of mange: San Guillermo National Park (San Juan, Argentina), created to preserve the two South American wild camelids in Argentina, and Pampa Galeras B\u00e1rbara D\u2019Achille National Reserve (Ayachuco, Per\u00fa), the latter which symbolized the recovery of the species from the brick of extinction in the 60s of the past century. In San Guillermo the problem probably has to do with the introduction of domestic camelids without sanitary controls or quarantine, while in the case of other populations it is due to mismanagement practices related to the capture and shearing of animals, including incomplete preventive veterinary treatments, management without welfare, and overcrowding of animals creating stress. This situation also causes huge economic losses to the local communities because of the drop of Vicu\u00f1a fibre price. A potential threat both in the Andes and worldwide, is the breeding of paco-Vicu\u00f1a (an alpaca/Vicu\u00f1a hybrid) mainly promoted in developed countries out of the Vicu\u00f1a distribution range for commercial purposes. The alpaca was domesticated from the Vicu\u00f1a approximately 6-7,000 years ago (Wheeler 2012). During domestication and subsequent selective breeding, the genome was modified away from its Vicu\u00f1a origin. Additional significant changes in the alpaca genome also occurred during the Spanish conquest when large numbers were slaughtered, and subsequent massive hybridization with llamas. DNA studies have shown that alpaca and llama pertain to different genera, Vicugna and Lama respectively, and at least 80% of alpacas in the Andes carry llama genes (Kadwell et al. 2001). Thus, hybridization between alpacas and Vicu\u00f1as represents a real threat because of the mixing of alpaca genes into the Vicu\u00f1a genome, something that has not occurred in nature.\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 3.2 Mining & quarrying. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 3, Name: 'Energy Production & Mining', Description: 'Threats from production of non-biological resources.'\nCode: 3.2, Name: 'Mining & Quarrying', Description: 'Exploring for, developing, and producing minerals and rocks.', Examples: 'coal strip mines, alluvial gold panning, gold mines, rock quarries, sand/salt mines, coral mining, deep sea nodules, guano harvesting, dredging outside of shipping lanes, etc.'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

It is both the loss of breeding areas and destruction of foraging habitat that is impacting the species (Camacho and S\u00e1ez-G\u00f3mez 2021). New renewable energy development, such as photovoltaic plants, are additionally leading to destruction of suitable habitat across Spain (Camacho and S\u00e1ez-G\u00f3mez 2021).

Habitat patches are also degraded by grazing stock, rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and kangaroos Macropus spp. that remove the shrub layer (Barrett et al. 2002). Firetails are also more likely to persist in a matrix of sheep grazing, a land-use that has been declining (ABARES 2020), than where surrounding areas are grazed by cattle or sown to grain crops (Barrett et al. 2002).

In East Africa, the primary issue is poisoning (particularly from the highly toxic pesticide carbofuran), which occurs primarily outside protected areas; the large range sizes of this species and G. rueppellii puts them at significant risk, as this means they inevitably spend considerable time outside protected areas (Ogada and Keesing 2010, Otieno et al. 2010, Kendall and Virani 2012). Hunting with lead ammunition may also be incidentally contributing to species mortality (Naidoo et al. 2017, Garbett et al. 2018). Evidence from wing-tagging and telemetry studies suggests that annual mortality, primarily from incidental poisoning, can be as high as 25% for the species (Kendall and Virani 2012). Cases across Africa suggest that the species may be subject to deliberate and accidental poisoning, respectively (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada et al. 2016b): in the former case for belief-based use and to prevent birds from drawing attention to poaching activities. Mass poisoning events include at least 144 White-backed Vultures killed after feeding on an elephant carcass in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe in 2012 (Groom et al. 2013); 76 died after feeding on 6 poisoned lion carcasses near Ruaha National Park, Tanzania in March 2018 (SSC 2018); 468 died after feeding on 3 elephant carcasses in Botswana in June 2019 (BirdGuides 2019). Modelling has shown that even one poisoned elephant carcass can have a dramatic impact on a population (Murn and Botha 2018). In southern Africa, vultures are caught and consumed for perceived medicinal and psychological benefits (McKean and Botha 2007), and the decline and possible extirpation in Nigeria has been attributed to the trade in vulture parts for traditional juju practices (P. Hall in litt. 2011). The species is recorded in trade in West and Central Africa, with an estimated 924-1,386 individuals traded over a six year period in West Africa, probably representing a significant proportion of the species's regional population (Buij et al. 2016). In South Africa, White-backed Vulture is one of the preferred vulture species in trade, according to a survey of traditional healers and traders (McKean et al. 2013). As a result of this and environmental pressures, it is predicted that the population in Zululand could become locally extinct in 26 years, unless harvest rates have been underestimated, in which case local extinction could be 10-11 years away (McKean and Botha 2007). There is also evidence that it is captured for international trade; for example in 2005, 13 individuals of this species being kept illegally in Italy were reportedly confiscated (F. Genero in litt. 2005).In 2007, diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, and which is fatal to Gyps spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses, was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2008). It was also reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden in litt. 2007) and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International 2008). However, given that livestock carrion is not generally left out for scavenger consumption, this is likely to have less of an impact than it has in south-east Asia (C. Kendall in litt. 2016).Electrocution on powerlines is also a problem in parts of its range, and it is vulnerable to nest harvesting or disturbance by humans (Bamford et al. 2009); perhaps more so than G. rueppellii, as it breeds in trees rather than on inaccessible cliffs (C. Kendall in litt. 2012). Additionally, the wild ungulate populations on which this species relies have declined precipitously throughout West and East Africa, even in protected areas (Western et al. 2009, Botha et al. 2017), and, despite increased livestock numbers, improved animal husbandry and carcass disposal has reduced the number of livestock carcasses available (Mundy et al. 1992). There is also a minor threat from road traffic, with individuals occasionally killed by vehicles (BirdLife Botswana 2008). Reported threats in the Athi-Kaputiei area in Kenya (an important breeding site for the species) include wind energy development, illegal logging of large trees (although Kendall et al. [2017] concluded that tree availability was not a limiting factor for vultures breeding in Masai Mara National Reserve), and natural gas exploration (Shema 2019).\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 5.1 Hunting & trapping terrestrial animals. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 5, Name: 'Biological Resource Use', Description: 'Threats from consumptive use of 'wild' biological resources including both deliberate and unintentional harvesting effects; also persecution or control of specific species.'\nCode: 5.1, Name: 'Hunting & Collecting Terrestrial Animals', Description: 'Killing or trapping terrestrial wild animals or animal products for commercial, recreation, subsistence, research, or cultural purposess, or for control/persecution reasons; includes accidental mortality/bycatch.'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

Aebischer in litt. 2009); there has been reported a strong correlation between rapid declines and those populations that winter in Spain (Carter 2007). An estimate of 430-1,800 individuals killed illegally in Spain annually indicates that this remains a significant problem for birds that do migrate and for the regional population (Brochet et al. 2016). The Spanish government released more than 1,500 tons of rodenticide-treated baits over about 500,000 ha to fight against a common vole plague in agricultural lands between August 2007 and April 2008; records of Red Kites dying by secondary poisoning in treated areas resulted (J. Vi\u00f1uela in litt. 2009). The total of recovered, confirmed poisoning cases in Spain is 1,187 individuals found dead between 1992 and 2015 (Cano et al. 2016). In north Scotland, 40% of birds found dead between 1989 and 2006 were found to have been killed by poisoning (Smart et al. 2010).In France populations disappeared at the same rate as conversion from grasslands to cereal crops (P. Tourret in litt. 2009). The decline of grazing livestock and farming intensification leading to chemical pollution, homogenization of landscapes and ecological impoverishment also threatens the species (Knott et al. 2009). Wind turbines are a potentially serious threat (Duchamp 2003, Mammen et al. 2009, Schaub 2012, P. Tourret in litt. 2009); 18 Red Kite were located having been killed by collisions with windfarms in 2019 (F. David in litt. 2020).

Feral cats Felis catus depredate chicks and adults. Heavy cat predation was recorded on North Coronado until the mid-1990s (Jehl and Bond 1975, Drost and Lewis 1995). The cat population at Catalina was most recently estimated at 600-750 individuals (Guttila and Stapp 2010) and eradication of cats and rats on the island has been regarded as \u2018not currently feasible\u2019 (Whitworth et al. 2014). Despite this however, many introduced predators have been removed from a number of breeding islands in recent decades (McChesney and Tershy 1998, Keitt 2005, Birt et al. 2012) with post-eradication increases noted (Whitworth and Carter 2017); the eradication of cats on some islands off the coast of western Baja California (Islas Coronado, Todos Santos, San Mart\u00edn and San Benito) in the late-1990s has likely resulted in recent population increases in such localities (Whitworth et al. 2020). Black Rats Rattus rattus prey on murrelet eggs and adults (Whitworth et al. 2014). Eradication of rats at Anacapa Island in 2001\u20132002 greatly improved murrelet hatching success in the following years (2003\u20132010) (Whitworth et al. 2005, 2013), with 191% more eggs hatching and 94% fewer nests being depredated (Newton et al. 2016). Hatching success remains very low on islands including St. Clementine however, a result of ongoing predation by foxes and black rats (Whitworth et al. 2018). House Mice Mus musculus were recently introduced to the Coronados Islands, and Deer Mice Peromyscus maniculatus anacapae (native to nearby Cedros Island) have also been introduced to the San Benito Islands. Deer Mice depredated 46% of all monitored eggs on Santa Barbara (Murray et al. 1983), which is the largest known breeding site for the species (Howard et al. 2014). However, on Anacapa, Deer Mice were established long before the introduction of rats, precluding them from consideration as the cause of declines there (Jones et al. 2005). Another problematic native species is the Barn Owl Tyto alba. Annual estimates of owl predation on Santa Barbara range from 11 to 172 individuals (Thomsen and Harvey 2012, Thomsen et al. 2013, Nur et al. 2013). Population growth modelling based on data collected between 1991 and 2010, resulted in an estimate of a 1.17% population decline owing to owl predation, and projections of a hypothetical 50-80% reduction in predation pressure could potentially result in a 1.15-2.54% positive growth rate, barring an increase in egg depredation from island mouse populations (Nur et al. 2013). This assessment implicated the role of Barn Owls in the suppression of the Scripps\u2019s Murrelet population recovery on Santa Barbara Island although recent evidence suggests that the presence of Barn Owls on Santa Barbara may have an indirect positive influence on Murrelet egg survival through increased predation on deer mice, and resultantly reduced egg predation from the mice themselves (Thomsen and Green 2016). Such interactions however, have been shown to shift with changing El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) rainfall conditions as changing rainfall, vegetation abundance and resultantly deer mouse populations can result in 15-fold increases in the predation of Murrelet by Owls in the absence of mice as a food source (Thomsen et al. 2018). It has recently been evidenced that fecundity is dramatically reduced during drought years due to enhanced egg predation by deer mice and population declines may result (Thomsen and Green 2019). Any increase in the frequency or severity of drought conditions will likely increase the rate of population decline in response. Various forms of pollution are threatening the species. The potential impacts of large and small oil spills in congregation waters near breeding islands is of great concern (Carter et al. 2000, Burkett et al. 2003). Long Beach Harbour is the largest oil port in western North America, with daily arrivals and departures of large oil tankers (USFWS 2005). Frequent oil spills occur in the vicinity of Long Beach Harbour, but most have not affected waters near Catalina (Carter 2003, Whitworth et al. 2014). As stated by Drost and Lewis (1995), pollution from offshore oil-wells or the Los Angeles oil-tanker lane could potentially extirpate the species from the south California Bight. Organochlorine pollutants are considered not to have a current significant effect on murrelets breeding at Catalina, but may have caused reduced reproduction or population size in the past, especially between the 1940s and 1970s, prior to the end of production and dumping of DDT in southern California waters (Drost and Lewis 1995, Whitworth et al. 2014). The potential impacts of bright lights used by squid fishing boats near breeding colonies is another concern, potentially causing disorientation and elevated predation pressures. Many owl-predated murrelets were found during a period of intense inshore squid fishing around Santa Catalina and disturbance from related activities could discourage nest-visitation and possibly cause collision mortalities (Whitworth et al. 2014). Human disturbance has been identified as a cause of nest abandonment and a major threat to the species (Howard et al. 2015). The two highest rates of abandonment on record were observed at the Dock and the Bunkhouse plots, which are directly associated with human structures. The human disturbance associated with these sites may also affect the remaining nesting birds. Machinery operations at the dock include high decibel engine noise and vibration of the dock structure, which along with frequent traffic, could be affecting nesting murrelets beneath the decking of these structures (Howard et al. 2015).Extreme fluctuations of sea surface temperature related to ENSO, are likely to affect food availability for the species, though the impact of such events appears to be small due to their generalist prey (USFWS 2016). In addition, the species's foraging behaviour puts it at risk from gill-net fisheries, although very few incidences have been reported (Carter et al. 2000). No mortality has been reported in nearshore gill-net fisheries in which other seabirds have relatively high bycatch rates (Pacific Seabird Group undated). However, the white seabass gill-net fishery operating around the northern California Channel Islands has very little observer coverage, potentially indicating that bycatch incidence has been underestimated or completely overlooked (Pacific Seabird Group undated).\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 9.6 Excess energy. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 9, Name: 'Pollution', Description: 'Threats from introduction of exotic and/or excess materials or energy from point and nonpoint sources.'\nCode: 9.6, Name: 'Excess Energy', Description: 'Inputs of heat, sound, or light that disturb wildlife or ecosystems.'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

The main driver of habitat loss is agricultural intensification and mechanisation which removes hedgerows and stone walls, the development of pine and eucalypt plantations and associated wildfire (e.g. in Galicia and northern Portugal), and the deliberate burning of scrub (summarised by Brito 2021), and in some areas (e.g. Navarra) infrastructure development (Bra\u00f1a 2002).Southern Europe is predicted to experience particularly extreme climate warming (up to 10 \u00b0C in some areas) by 2100 and increasing aridity (IPCC 2013).

Although the species occupies a wide range of habitats, it is a specialist of humid, well-vegetated areas with little or no woody vegetation. It is therefore sensitive to the modification or disappearance of these habitats, and the isolation and loss of subpopulations appears to be ongoing on both Iberian plateaux as a result of agricultural intensification (Pollo 2015). In these areas the species seems to be confined to small 'islands' of remnant vegetation within an agricultural matrix (Pollo 2015). In the east of its range a similar pattern is seemingly underway as a result of increasing aridity, which may be exacerbated by climate change (Pollo 2015). Water diversion from wet meadows in the El Padul region seems to have resulted in a local extinction as the species has not been recorded in this area since 2009 and is no longer known to survive in the Sierra Nevada, the southeastern limit of its range (Pollo 2015). Fires have potentially complex consequences for this species, with suggestions both that they facilitate dispersal through opening grassy areas and that they destroy important structural features used as shelter sites (Pollo 2015). Agricultural intensification increases the species' exposure to chemical pollutants, but any impacts of this are unstudied (Pollo 2015).The invasive cat's claw (Hottentot-fig, Carpobrotus edulis) is a threat in coastal grasslands, with skink densities declining from 25.2 in sites with 75-90% coverage of the invasive vine to 4.9 individuals/ha in sites with more than 90% cover (Pollo 2015).This species is persecuted in parts of its range as it is mistakenly believed to be toxic (Pollo 2015).\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 7.2 Dams & water management/use. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 7, Name: 'Natural System Modifications', Description: 'Threats from actions that convert or degrade habitat in service of managing natural or semi-natural systems, often to improve human welfare.'\nCode: 7.2, Name: 'Dams & Water Management/Use', Description: 'Changing water flow patterns from their natural range of variation either deliberately or as a result of other activities.'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

In Nigeria, a survey of medicinal traders found that Hooded Vulture was the most commonly traded species of vulture, with 90% of all vulture parts traded belonging to the species (Saidu and Buij 2013, Williams et al. 2021a), and both deliberate and unintentional poisoning remains on the increase despite general local awareness (Owolabi et al. 2020). Across West and central Africa the species is one of the most heavily traded, with an estimated 5,850-8,772 individuals traded over a six-year period in West Africa (Buij et al. 2016). Hooded Vulture meat is reportedly sold as chicken in some places (Ogada and Buij 2011, Buij et al. 2016). Trade for vulture parts has almost completely extirpated vultures from parts of their range, for example in Edo State, southern Nigeria (Nosazeogie et al. 2018). In the world's largest vulture poisoning incident to date, more than 2,000 vultures, most of which were Hooded Vultures, were killed in Guinea Bissau at the beginning of 2020, believed to have been driven by demand for body parts for belief-based use (BirdLife International 2020, Henriques et al. 2020). It now appears that there is considerable cross-border trade in vulture parts, with poisoning incidents also recently noted in the Gambia as well as further incidents in Guinea Bissau (D. Ogada in litt. 2022b). Intentional poisoning of vultures may be carried out in some areas by poachers in order to hide the locations of their kills. In 2018 seven Hooded Vultures were killed at an elephant carcass in Mozambique that had been laced with carbofuran by a poacher (SSC 2018), and in 2019 28 Hooded Vultures were killed at three poisoned elephant carcasses in Botswana (BirdGuides 2019). In Senegal vultures receive a form of cultural protection from such killing because they are the totem for some families (B. Bargain in litt. 2016). Secondary poisoning with pesticides at livestock baits being used to poison mammalian predators and feral dogs is also an issue in East Africa (Otieno et al. 2010, C. Kendall in litt. 2012, Roxburgh and McDougall 2012) and parts of West Africa (Mulli\u00e9 et al. 2017). Despite diclofenac being found on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2008) and marketed, it is not thought that this has been directly affecting the species significantly.Declines have also been attributed to land conversion through development and improvements to abattoir hygiene and rubbish disposal in some areas (Ogada and Buij 2011), and, in Senegal, a decline in the number of their favourite nesting tree species (B. Bargain in litt. 2016, Mulli\u00e9 et al. 2017). The species may also be threatened by avian influenza (H5N1), from which it appears to suffer some mortality and which it probably acquires from feeding on discarded dead poultry (Ducatez et al. 2007), although this is not well substantiated (C. Kendall in litt. 2016). In Burkina Faso, the main anthropogenic threats to reproductive output are poaching of eggs, chicks and collection of nesting materials and pruning of nest trees (Dabone et al. 2019). According to questionnaires conducted primarily with abattoir workers in Uganda, electrocution and collision with power lines may be a significant cause of mortality (Magin 2017).\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 5.1 Hunting & trapping terrestrial animals. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 5, Name: 'Biological Resource Use', Description: 'Threats from consumptive use of 'wild' biological resources including both deliberate and unintentional harvesting effects; also persecution or control of specific species.'\nCode: 5.1, Name: 'Hunting & Collecting Terrestrial Animals', Description: 'Killing or trapping terrestrial wild animals or animal products for commercial, recreation, subsistence, research, or cultural purposess, or for control/persecution reasons; includes accidental mortality/bycatch.'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

Research to identify the most important factors driving this decline is urgently needed. The decline in Western Europe has been attributed to a combination of persecution and agricultural intensification. Habitat loss and fragmentation due to intensive building of industrial estates, alongside the improvement of road networks and infrastructure, are severely disturbing natural population dynamics and lead to highly endangered \u201cisland populations\u201d. Habitat fragmentation also causes loss of genetic diversity (Banaszek et al. 2011; Banaszek and Ziomek 2012; La Haye et al. 2012; Neuman et al. 2004, 2005; Reiners et al. 2014). Agricultural intensification\u2014specifically the loss of perennial crops, the lack of crop diversity, large scale monocultural farming, and the use of pesticides\u2014are suspected to have a negative impact. Moreover, it was shown in Alsace that body mass of the hamsters at emergence from hibernation decreased by 20% in the last 70 years. It was suggested that maize monocultures and climate change have such adverse effects on body mass (Tissier et al. 2016). The current change in agricultural practices in Central and Eastern Europe is a real threat in the near future (Hegyeli et al. 2015). In former times, Common Hamster was trapped and poisoned to prevent damage to crops. The hamsters were also trapped for the fur trade (Nechay 2000). A recent analysis of reproduction parameters revealed a global decrease in the number of litters, embryos and newborns to such an extent that the populations potentially might shrink by 50% each year. The reasons for reproduction breakdown most probably are related to climate change, light pollution, or fur trapping in the past (Surov et al. 2016). Light pollution is an often underestimated threat. It acts on the physiology and behaviour of the species through endocrine and neurobiological processes which affect, amongst others, reproduction in birds and mammals (for a review see Navara and Nelson 2007, Gaston et al. 2013). For the Common Hamster there is not only a spatial coincidence between highly light polluted areas and areas with the strongest decline but also a temporal coincidence between the period of decline and increasing light intensities (Surov et al. 2016). Moreover, light exposure during only two winter nights shifted the onset of its reproductive phase by 3-4 weeks (Monecke et al. 2010). The fact that, nevertheless, some populations are doing quite well in a few cities is not a contradiction: good food availability and rain-sheltered areas within a town might override the negative effect of light pollution in these populations.\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 4.1 Roads & railroads. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 4, Name: 'Transportation & Service Corridors', Description: 'Threats from long narrow transport corridors and the vehicles that use them including associated wildlife mortality.'\nCode: 4.1, Name: 'Roads & Railroads', Description: 'Surface transport on roadways and dedicated tracks.', Examples: 'highways, secondary roads, primitive roads, logging roads, bridges & causeways, road kill, fencing a'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

Human populations are increasing and expanding. In the last census, the Amazon region registered the highest population growth in Brazil. Illegal settlements, road opening and deforestation threaten pristine habitats. Colonization of new areas are expected, followed by intensive exploitation of natural resources. Furthermore, proposed mega-projects in the 2007 Brazilian Growth Acceleration Plan represent a significant threat to Brazilian Amazonian and Pantanal habitats. Changes in government and environmental protection policies in Brazil endanger the pristine areas of the Amazon, Pantanal and Cerrado. Between 2017 and 2019 4,500 km\u00b2 of the Amazon were lost due to deforestation and burning, of which 65% occurred in 2019 (Cannon 2019, https://news.mongabay.com/2019/11/deforestation-preceded-fires-in-massive-area-of-amazon-in-2019/). From August to November of 2019, at least 1.5 million hectares of Brazilian Pantanal were burned (https://www.dw.com/en/brazils-next-fire-disaster-in-the-pantanal-wetlands/a-51199164). Hunting for the pelt trade was the greatest threat to the Giant Otter in the past and the species came close to extinction in the early 1970s in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazilian Pantanal (Duplaix 1980). From 1960 to 1969, records indicated a regional harvest of 12,390 giant otter skins. In 1973, giant otters were placed on CITES Appendix I, and the enforcement of international trade restrictions on Giant Otter skins in 1975 finally ended Giant Otter hunting (Recharte and Bodmer 2010). The Giant Otter remains endangered because of the low recuperation rate of relict populations now also under pressure from human activities (Groenendijk et al. 2015). Direct conflict between humans and otters is an increasing problem. Otters may be killed for fun or out of fear, or, more often, because they are seen as competitors for fish by loggers, miners, and fishermen, who often blame them for depleting fish resources used for local and commercial consumption (G\u00f3mez and Jorgensen 1999, Recharte et al. 2008, Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2012, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Giant Otters can drown in fishing nets and traps and are also blamed for damaging them (Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2012, Utreras et al. 2013). Fish farming is rapidly increasing in the species\u2019 range, for example in parts of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and expose otters to retaliation killing (V. Utreras pers. obs.). Cubs are sometimes captured illegally to be kept as pets (M. Marmontel pers. obs). Giant Otters are highly susceptible to persecution: they are large, conspicuous, social, and very vocal. They are active at daytime and occupy open habitats and stable territories. Their signs\u2014latrines and dens\u2014are easily recognizable, making it possible to identify areas of recent activity by a group (Groenendijk et al. 2005). Individuals and groups often react to people by approaching to investigate. Moreover, only the dominant pair produces young, and usually only once a year. During the pelt trade years, these life history attributes made them an easy target for fishermen. In 2017, a Giant Otter group was killed by fishermen in the Pantanal and according to locals, kills occur frequently during the fishing season (C. Leuchtenberger pers. obs.). In 2011\u20132012, the Kanamari indigenous people promoted a massive Giant Otter killing in their territory (Territ\u00f3rio Ind\u00edgena Kanamari), based on their perception that the species was overfishing the river turtle population. The community leader bought 300 cartridges for the hunters, who shot 64 Giant Otters (Endo pers. comm. 2012). Such incidents of targeted killing can lead to extinction of small populations in a watershed. Gold mining, artisanal as well as industrial, is a significant threat to the species, particularly in the Guiana Shield region, in southeastern Peru, the western region of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and northern Pantanal. The main impacts are habitat destruction, sedimentation of rivers, and pollution (Kimbrough 2014). Gold miners cut swathes into the floodplain forest and blast river banks with pressure hoses, using mercury to amalgamate gold particles. Gold prices are at a record high, whereas mercury is inexpensive. Forest conversion to mining increased six-fold from 2003\u20132006 to 2006\u20132009 (Swenson et al. 2011). Even a decade after mining stopped, areas affected still had depleted fish populations and had not been re-colonized by otters. In areas of gold mining, fish are contaminated with mercury. Gutleb et al. (1997) found that mercury concentrations in the majority of fish near Manu National Park were higher than considered tolerable for the Eurasian otter. Migration of contaminated fish and long-range atmospheric transport of mercury probably increase the area of influence of such contaminants. Contamination of otters by other heavy metals through pesticides and other agrochemicals is still poorly understood. The many planned hydroelectric dams in the species\u2019 range are a major threat to Giant Otters. These will alter hydrological regimes of rivers and affect fish populations and habitat (Latrubesse et al. 2017). Dams disrupt the annual cycles of inundations, vital for the maintenance of populations of flood dependent species such as the Giant Otter (Mour\u00e3o et al. 2010, Alho and Sabino 2011). One hundred and eighty-four new dams are planned or under construction, greater than two MW capacity over the next 20 years in the Amazon. These dams would include five of the six major Andean tributaries of the Amazon. Sixty per cent of the dams would cause the first major break in connectivity between protected Andean headwaters and the lowland Amazon. Giant Otters are able to live in some artificial lakes, such as the shallow Balbina Reservoir in Brazil (Rosas et al. 2007). In other areas, hydroelectric dams have depleted Giant Otter populations, as did the Curu\u00e1-Una Hydroelectric in the Brazilian Amazonia (Rosas et al. 2007). Around the Pantanal, there are over 115 projects of small hydroelectric plants. Other major infrastructure projects include the Inter-oceanic highway in southeastern Peru, and the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America (V. Utreras pers. comm. 2012). Giant Otters are vulnerable to disturbance from poorly managed tourism, including sport fishing. It is important to control increasing levels of tourism on lakes and rivers both in and outside protected areas (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Research has shown that Giant Otter reproductive success and sighting success by tourists is considerably lower on unmanaged lakes than on managed lakes (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Giant Otter cubs held in captivity have died of canine parvovirus, and all mustelids are susceptible to canine distemper, so domestic animal diseases may pose a serious threat to wild Giant Otter populations. Infection can also occur in remote areas, since transient otters and people hunting with dogs travel large distances with potential for contact and infection of vulnerable otter populations (Schenck et al. 1999). Climatic changes are predicted to increase suitable areas for Giant Otters (Cianfrani et al. 2018). However, long-term habitat and climatic modifications will increase the exposure of suitable core otter areas to the negative effects of the surrounding unsuitable areas (Cianfrani et al. 2018).

        "question": "Complete the threat assessment by making assessments for scope and severity for the \"Giant Otter\" (\"Pteronura brasiliensis\"). \n\nHere are the scoring instructions from the IUCN: For each threat, it is recommended that the scope (i.e., the proportion of the total population affected) and severity (i.e., the overall declines caused by the threat) should be recorded. Severity should be scored within the scope of the particular threat. For example, if hunting (i.e., threat code 5.1.1) is identified as a threat within one particular region only, the severity is scored as the % rate of decline to the population within that region only.\n\nThe threat description from IUCN is \"The species is threatened by multiple human activities throughout its range, destruction of riparian habitat, overfishing, contamination of water bodies\u2014especially by gold mining, fossil fuel exploration, and the use of pesticides and fertilizers, diseases spread by domestic animals, and mismanaged tourism (Duplaix 1980, Schenck 1999, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Human populations are increasing and expanding. In the last census, the Amazon region registered the highest population growth in Brazil. Illegal settlements, road opening and deforestation threaten pristine habitats. Colonization of new areas are expected, followed by intensive exploitation of natural resources. Furthermore, proposed mega-projects in the 2007 Brazilian Growth Acceleration Plan represent a significant threat to Brazilian Amazonian and Pantanal habitats. Changes in government and environmental protection policies in Brazil endanger the pristine areas of the Amazon, Pantanal and Cerrado. Between 2017 and 2019 4,500 km\u00b2 of the Amazon were lost due to deforestation and burning, of which 65% occurred in 2019 (Cannon 2019, https://news.mongabay.com/2019/11/deforestation-preceded-fires-in-massive-area-of-amazon-in-2019/). From August to November of 2019, at least 1.5 million hectares of Brazilian Pantanal were burned (https://www.dw.com/en/brazils-next-fire-disaster-in-the-pantanal-wetlands/a-51199164). Hunting for the pelt trade was the greatest threat to the Giant Otter in the past and the species came close to extinction in the early 1970s in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazilian Pantanal (Duplaix 1980). From 1960 to 1969, records indicated a regional harvest of 12,390 giant otter skins. In 1973, giant otters were placed on CITES Appendix I, and the enforcement of international trade restrictions on Giant Otter skins in 1975 finally ended Giant Otter hunting (Recharte and Bodmer 2010). The Giant Otter remains endangered because of the low recuperation rate of relict populations now also under pressure from human activities (Groenendijk et al. 2015). Direct conflict between humans and otters is an increasing problem. Otters may be killed for fun or out of fear, or, more often, because they are seen as competitors for fish by loggers, miners, and fishermen, who often blame them for depleting fish resources used for local and commercial consumption (G\u00f3mez and Jorgensen 1999, Recharte et al. 2008, Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2012, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Giant Otters can drown in fishing nets and traps and are also blamed for damaging them (Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2012, Utreras et al. 2013). Fish farming is rapidly increasing in the species\u2019 range, for example in parts of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and expose otters to retaliation killing (V. Utreras pers. obs.). Cubs are sometimes captured illegally to be kept as pets (M. Marmontel pers. obs). Giant Otters are highly susceptible to persecution: they are large, conspicuous, social, and very vocal. They are active at daytime and occupy open habitats and stable territories. Their signs\u2014latrines and dens\u2014are easily recognizable, making it possible to identify areas of recent activity by a group (Groenendijk et al. 2005). Individuals and groups often react to people by approaching to investigate. Moreover, only the dominant pair produces young, and usually only once a year. During the pelt trade years, these life history attributes made them an easy target for fishermen. In 2017, a Giant Otter group was killed by fishermen in the Pantanal and according to locals, kills occur frequently during the fishing season (C. Leuchtenberger pers. obs.). In 2011\u20132012, the Kanamari indigenous people promoted a massive Giant Otter killing in their territory (Territ\u00f3rio Ind\u00edgena Kanamari), based on their perception that the species was overfishing the river turtle population. The community leader bought 300 cartridges for the hunters, who shot 64 Giant Otters (Endo pers. comm. 2012). Such incidents of targeted killing can lead to extinction of small populations in a watershed.

Rats have invaded at least three of the Japanese breeding islands, with current impacts largely unknown, but likely to affect fledgling success and egg predation (Lee 2010). The shearwaters appear to suffer significant impacts from rats on Mikura-Jima, which is populated by c.300 people and is popular with tourists, thus making an eradication programme problematic and the subsequent reintroduction of rats more likely (Oka et al. 2002, J. Croxall in litt. 2011). Feral cats may also be inflicting increasing mortality on the Mikura-Jima population through predation on chicks, young birds and adults (N. Oka per M. Sato in litt. 2012, S. Uematsu in litt. 2012). Efforts are being taken to capture and neuter feral cats, however due to pressure from the public, cats are hard to eliminate. Currently, climate change is affecting foraging distribution and hence energetic budgets of adults. It is further predicted that whole colonies may be affected in the future as prey populations shift distribution in response to climate change. In addition to these threats, the species is also susceptible to fisheries bycatch (Birds Korea 2010, J. Croxall in litt. 2011), but the impact has not been quantified. Research suggests the Fukushima nuclear accident may have had negative impacts on birds breeding on Mikura Island, with reduced vitamin A levels detected in chicks following the release of radioactive material (Uematsu et al. 2014).

Lizards of the genus Gallotia appear to represent an important secondary prey item for feral cats in areas where the lizards are abundant (Nogales and Medina 2009).The California Kingsnake was introduced to Gran Canaria in 1998 (Cabrera-P\u00e9rez et al. 2012), and has now become established in areas of the North, East and South zones of the island (Piquet and L\u00f3pez-Darias 2021). Piquet and L\u00f3pez-Darias (2021) found that the lizard was now absent from 86% of invaded sites in these areas, and most of the invaded sites where lizards survived were at the edge of the snake's invasive range. The snake is known to prey on the Gran Canaria Giant Lizard (Monz\u00f3n-Arg\u00fcello et al. 2015), and this is presumably the mechanism driving declines. The greater severity of observed impacts of snake invasion on this lizard compared with the island's other two native lizards may reflect its diurnal habits (Piquet and L\u00f3pez-Darias 2021), as the California Kingsnake's diet in its native range consists largely of diurnal, surface-active lizards (Wiseman et al. 2019). Surviving animals in invaded regions are disproportionately large animals that are likely to have grown to maturity before snakes invaded these sites, suggesting that recruitment following invasion is negligible or non-existent, and the lizard is no longer found in the longest-invaded areas (Piquet et al. 2022). It is consequently likely that the species will become extinct in invaded sites in the absence of strong immigration from uninvaded areas (Piquet et al. 2022). No evidence of morphological adaptation has been found following snake invasion, suggesting that the species will be unable to adapt in time to prevent its extinction from much of Gran Canaria (Piquet et al. 2022).The introduced snake is now found across more than 50% of the island (based on records taken between 2009 and 2020; Piquet et al. 2022) and its range is still expanding, but may not colonise uplands/cliff areas (M.A. Carretero pers. comm. October 2022).

For example, if hunting (i.e., threat code 5.1.1) is identified as a threat within one particular region only, the severity is scored as the % rate of decline to the population within that region only.\n\nThe threat description from IUCN is \"Although this species is generally still abundant in noninvaded parts of the island, it is impacted by predation by feral cats and rats. Lizards of the genus Gallotia appear to represent an important secondary prey item for feral cats in areas where the lizards are abundant (Nogales and Medina 2009).The California Kingsnake was introduced to Gran Canaria in 1998 (Cabrera-P\u00e9rez et al. 2012), and has now become established in areas of the North, East and South zones of the island (Piquet and L\u00f3pez-Darias 2021). Piquet and L\u00f3pez-Darias (2021) found that the lizard was now absent from 86% of invaded sites in these areas, and most of the invaded sites where lizards survived were at the edge of the snake's invasive range. The snake is known to prey on the Gran Canaria Giant Lizard (Monz\u00f3n-Arg\u00fcello et al. 2015), and this is presumably the mechanism driving declines. The greater severity of observed impacts of snake invasion on this lizard compared with the island's other two native lizards may reflect its diurnal habits (Piquet and L\u00f3pez-Darias 2021), as the California Kingsnake's diet in its native range consists largely of diurnal, surface-active lizards (Wiseman et al. 2019). Surviving animals in invaded regions are disproportionately large animals that are likely to have grown to maturity before snakes invaded these sites, suggesting that recruitment following invasion is negligible or non-existent, and the lizard is no longer found in the longest-invaded areas (Piquet et al. 2022). It is consequently likely that the species will become extinct in invaded sites in the absence of strong immigration from uninvaded areas (Piquet et al. 2022). No evidence of morphological adaptation has been found following snake invasion, suggesting that the species will be unable to adapt in time to prevent its extinction from much of Gran Canaria (Piquet et al. 2022).The introduced snake is now found across more than 50% of the island (based on records taken between 2009 and 2020; Piquet et al. 2022) and its range is still expanding, but may not colonise uplands/cliff areas (M.A. Carretero pers. comm.

The positive trends in two cormorant spp. that do not compete with fisheries for prey (Phalacrocorax lucidus, Microcarbo coronatus), contrasted by the negative trends in species that do (P. capensis, P. neglectus) supports the role of fishing in causing population declines via reduced prey availability (Crawford 2015). Oil pollution is a threat which has had severe impacts on the population in the past and is likely to strike again. The species\u2019 foraging behaviour makes it highly vulnerable to oiling and it responds poorly to rehabilitation efforts. On past occasions, spillage of fish oils caused mass mortality of cormorants. The best-documented case (Walvis Bay, 1974) recorded more than 4,500 fatalities, principally due to starvation resulting from loss of flight ability (Kemper and Simmons 2015). Predation by Great White Pelican Pelecanus onocrotalus, Fur Seal Arctocephalus pusillus, Sacred Ibis Threskiornis aethiopicus and Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus are major causes of mortality for Cape Cormorants. De Ponte Machado (2007) reports increasing levels of depredation of cormorant nests by Great White Pelicans on Malgas, Jutten and Schaapen islands, South Africa, leading to whole-colony abandonment in some cases. Observations of pelicans prospecting in locations where they were previously unrecorded, suggest that pelican predation is an increasing threat. Fur Seal predation on fledglings has also increased since conservation measures were put in place to protect the seal (David et al. 2003), and has been found to represent a significant mortality factor for cormorant fledglings on Dyer Island, South Africa (24%) (Marks et al. 1997, Makhado et al. 2013) and Ichaboe Island, Namibia (Du Toit et al. 2004). Scared Ibis is another major predator of eggs and chicks, taking an estimated 960 cormorant eggs and chicks in one season on Penguin Island and removing a significant proportion of the local population\u2019s potential productivity (Williams and Ward 2006). Voorbergen et al. (2012) recorded c. 5% fledgling mortality by Kelp Gulls on Dyer Island, but regarded this as an underestimate of actual predation levels. Climate change displaces critical forage resources to the south and east, causing a mismatch in the distribution of cormorant breeding sites and the location of their prey (Crawford et al. 2015). Although the species may move between breeding localities (Crawford et al. 1994), they also show fidelity to natal and nest sites (Berry 1977, Hockey et al. 2005). In 1992, Avian Cholera Pasteurella multocida was deemed responsible for the death of 14,500 Cape Cormorants on eight studied islands, amounting to 8% of the breeding population in these colonies. Mortality rates as high as 16% (of breeding population) were recorded and among the six cholera outbreaks recorded in 1940, Cape Cormorants were the species that experienced greatest mortality (Crawford et al. 1992a, Barnes 2000, Waller and Underhill 2007). Guano mining is another threat that has had adverse effects on the species in the past and is likely to return.

Key threats (also see table below) include habitat loss, exploitation, harassment at roosts, electrocution, shooting in orchards, and tick paralysis (Westcott et al. 2001, DERM 2010, Dennis 2012, Woinarski et al. 2014).Decline of P. conspicillatus in Australia has been associated with habitat loss, and persecution such as electrocution and shooting at orchards (Garnett et al. 1999, DERM 2010). The impact of lethal crop protection is believed to have decreased in recent years with prohibition of high voltage electricity grids and with the wide-spread adoption of canopy netting on orchards. However, permits to shoot flying-foxes for commercial crop protection were re-instated by the Queensland government in 2012 after a four-year ban. Rates of clearing of rainforest in the coastal and upland areas in the majority of the Wet Tropics Bioregion have been reduced and are no longer significant (Queensland Herbarium 2014, D. Westcott pers. comm.). However, there has been an intensification of agriculture on the dry western margins of the range and an increase in clearing of sclerophyll vegetation types important for the species in these areas (Queensland Herbarium 2014, D. Westcott pers. comm). Habitat loss for human development impacts coastal areas and plateaus. Recent escalation in rates of transition of sclerophyll vegetation types to closed rainforest has been documented and attributed to changed fire management regimes (Stanton et al. 2014).Conflict between humans and P. conspicillatus in built up areas appears to be growing as the proportion of the population using roosts in urban areas increases (Tait et al. 2014). Methods for ameliorating conflict typically include modification or removal of roosting vegetation and the use of noise and other disturbances to disperse animals away from human occupied areas. The long-term impact of dispersals on P. conspicillatus is unknown. However, conflict at roosts hinders conservation measures.More recently, tick paralysis has been identified as an increasing threat to the species (Fox et al. 2008, Fox 2011, Buettner et al. 2013). Buettner et al. (2013) found that mortality varied between years, with more adult females affected than males.Pteropus conspicillatus are also threatened by mortality from entanglement in backyard drape netting, collision and entanglement in barbed-wire fences, electrocution on power lines, cleft palate and other birth deformities (Richards et al. 2008, Shilton et al. 2008, DERM 2010, J. Maclean pers. comm.).The impact of climate change is unclear but is likely to increase the severity of cyclones and other extreme weather (i.e., heat events) that can kill large numbers and impact the feeding and roosting habitat of the species (DERM 2010). The recent invasion of myrtle rust and tramp ants (electric and yellow crazy ants) into the Wet Tropics region is also a concern for the future status of Wet Tropics species (Metcalfe et al. 2014). In PNG and Indonesia, the range of P. conspicillatus is typically confined to coastal lowlands and islands. These areas are most densely populated by people and subject to the most rapid land use change as documented by remote sensing (Hansen et al. 2013, Stibig et al. 2014). Increasing rates of habitat loss or modification through residential expansion and the clearing of large tracts of forests for expanding oil palm production continue to be a major threat to the species (T. Leary pers. comm.). Logging operations are also expanding in the range of P. conspicillatus, particularly in the West Papua province of Indonesia and the Madang and Morobe provinces of PNG (Stibig et al. 2014). Hunting is another significant threat as flying-foxes are an important food source for many communities and sold as food at local markets (Mack and West 2005, S. Hamilton and T. Leary pers. comm., B. Roberts pers. obs). In both Madang and Lae, P. conspicillatus are hunted and disturbed on an almost daily basis (T. Leary pers. comm, B. Roberts pers. obs.). The impacts of these threats combined with the species\u2019s low reproductive output (Fox et al. 2008) and the population\u2019s low estimated average exponential rate of increase (Westcott et al. 2018) highlight the likelihood of continual decline into the projected future.\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 2.1 Annual & perennial non-timber crops. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 2, Name: 'Agriculture & Aquaculture', Description: 'Threats from farming and ranching as a result of agricultural expansion and intensification, including silviculture, mariculture and aquaculture (includes the impacts of any fencing around farmed areas)'\nCode: 2.1, Name: 'Annual & Perennial Non-Timber Crops', Description: 'Crops planted for food, fodder, fibre, fuel, or other uses.'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

But overall, it is not significantly threatened.Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to B. dendrobatidis (Bd), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world. Both pathogens cause the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, and both are believed to have originated in Asia (for Bsal: Martel et al. 2014, for Bd: O'Hanlon et al. 2018). While Bd can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, Bsal has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel et al. 2013). Bd has spread globally, but at present Bsal is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel et al. 2014, Nguyen et al. 2017). Currently in Europe, Bsal has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g., Thein et al. 2020) and Spain (Martel et al. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel et al. 2014). Laboratory trials for susceptibility to Bsal demonstrate that Salamandrina perspicillata is susceptible to the disease. Only juveniles have been tested, but 100% mortality was observed (F. Pasmans and A. Martel pers. comm. June 2021). While Bsal is not present in this species' range yet, there is a risk from nearby outbreaks, with the nearest outbreak occurring 743 km away.

In 1983-1984, over 2,500 were flown out of Bah\u00eda Negra, Paraguay, with an additional 600 in the late 1980s (J. Pryor in litt. 1998). Although these numbers are now much reduced, illegal trade still continues (e.g. 10 passed through a pet market in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, in August 2004-July 2005, where birds were changing hands for US$ 1,000 and were destined for Peru [Herrera and Hennessey 2007]). More recently it has been noted that there appears to be almost no illegal trade in this species in Bolivia (B. Hennessey in litt. 2012) or Brazil (A. C. Lees in litt. 2015). Across its range, there is some local hunting for food and feathers. In Amazonia, there has been habitat loss for cattle-ranching and hydroelectric power schemes on the rios Tocantins and Xingu. In the Pantanal, only 5% of S. apetala trees have suitable cavities (Guedes 1993, Johnson 1996). Young trees are foraged by cattle and burnt by frequent fires (Newton 1994).

Plausible threats include the loss of habitat through land clearing, particularly along the slopes of the Great Dividing Range, and a reduction in nest hollow availability due to forest management practices (NSW OEH 2020). For urban populations, clearing for housing can lead to the destruction of nest sites. Gang-gang Cockatoos breed mainly in mature forest (Loyn 1985) and decline with increasing removal of old trees (Loyn and Kennedy 2009). Fire poses a threat, destroying nest trees and suppressing seed production in key feed species (Koch 2003). Higher temperatures may also be having an effect (Herold et al. 2018), with heat waves implicated in the premature fledging of nestling Gang-gang Cockatoos (Cameron et al. 2021). Extreme fire weather (Di Virgilio et al. 2019, Dowdy et al. 2019) driven by longer and more severe droughts (Evans et al. 2017) and more frequent heat waves (Herold et al. 2018) are likely to increase in frequency and intensity in coming decades. Given the broad-scale reduction in older-aged montane forests (Lindenmayer et al. 2015), and the time required for trees to form large hollows, it is plausible that hollow availability has declined across the range, probably leading to increased competition for hollows from other hollow-dependent birds, mammals and maybe European honey bees Apis melifera (Davey et al. 2019, M.

The positive trends in two cormorant spp. that do not compete with fisheries for prey (Phalacrocorax lucidus, Microcarbo coronatus), contrasted by the negative trends in species that do (P. capensis, P. neglectus) supports the role of fishing in causing population declines via reduced prey availability (Crawford 2015). Oil pollution is a threat which has had severe impacts on the population in the past and is likely to strike again. The species\u2019 foraging behaviour makes it highly vulnerable to oiling and it responds poorly to rehabilitation efforts. On past occasions, spillage of fish oils caused mass mortality of cormorants. The best-documented case (Walvis Bay, 1974) recorded more than 4,500 fatalities, principally due to starvation resulting from loss of flight ability (Kemper and Simmons 2015). Predation by Great White Pelican Pelecanus onocrotalus, Fur Seal Arctocephalus pusillus, Sacred Ibis Threskiornis aethiopicus and Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus are major causes of mortality for Cape Cormorants. De Ponte Machado (2007) reports increasing levels of depredation of cormorant nests by Great White Pelicans on Malgas, Jutten and Schaapen islands, South Africa, leading to whole-colony abandonment in some cases. Observations of pelicans prospecting in locations where they were previously unrecorded, suggest that pelican predation is an increasing threat. Fur Seal predation on fledglings has also increased since conservation measures were put in place to protect the seal (David et al. 2003), and has been found to represent a significant mortality factor for cormorant fledglings on Dyer Island, South Africa (24%) (Marks et al. 1997, Makhado et al. 2013) and Ichaboe Island, Namibia (Du Toit et al. 2004). Scared Ibis is another major predator of eggs and chicks, taking an estimated 960 cormorant eggs and chicks in one season on Penguin Island and removing a significant proportion of the local population\u2019s potential productivity (Williams and Ward 2006). Voorbergen et al. (2012) recorded c. 5% fledgling mortality by Kelp Gulls on Dyer Island, but regarded this as an underestimate of actual predation levels. Climate change displaces critical forage resources to the south and east, causing a mismatch in the distribution of cormorant breeding sites and the location of their prey (Crawford et al. 2015). Although the species may move between breeding localities (Crawford et al. 1994), they also show fidelity to natal and nest sites (Berry 1977, Hockey et al. 2005). In 1992, Avian Cholera Pasteurella multocida was deemed responsible for the death of 14,500 Cape Cormorants on eight studied islands, amounting to 8% of the breeding population in these colonies. Mortality rates as high as 16% (of breeding population) were recorded and among the six cholera outbreaks recorded in 1940, Cape Cormorants were the species that experienced greatest mortality (Crawford et al. 1992a, Barnes 2000, Waller and Underhill 2007).

Key threats (also see table below) include habitat loss, exploitation, harassment at roosts, electrocution, shooting in orchards, and tick paralysis (Westcott et al. 2001, DERM 2010, Dennis 2012, Woinarski et al. 2014).Decline of P. conspicillatus in Australia has been associated with habitat loss, and persecution such as electrocution and shooting at orchards (Garnett et al. 1999, DERM 2010). The impact of lethal crop protection is believed to have decreased in recent years with prohibition of high voltage electricity grids and with the wide-spread adoption of canopy netting on orchards. However, permits to shoot flying-foxes for commercial crop protection were re-instated by the Queensland government in 2012 after a four-year ban. Rates of clearing of rainforest in the coastal and upland areas in the majority of the Wet Tropics Bioregion have been reduced and are no longer significant (Queensland Herbarium 2014, D. Westcott pers. comm.). However, there has been an intensification of agriculture on the dry western margins of the range and an increase in clearing of sclerophyll vegetation types important for the species in these areas (Queensland Herbarium 2014, D. Westcott pers. comm). Habitat loss for human development impacts coastal areas and plateaus. Recent escalation in rates of transition of sclerophyll vegetation types to closed rainforest has been documented and attributed to changed fire management regimes (Stanton et al. 2014).Conflict between humans and P. conspicillatus in built up areas appears to be growing as the proportion of the population using roosts in urban areas increases (Tait et al. 2014). Methods for ameliorating conflict typically include modification or removal of roosting vegetation and the use of noise and other disturbances to disperse animals away from human occupied areas. The long-term impact of dispersals on P. conspicillatus is unknown. However, conflict at roosts hinders conservation measures.More recently, tick paralysis has been identified as an increasing threat to the species (Fox et al. 2008, Fox 2011, Buettner et al. 2013). Buettner et al. (2013) found that mortality varied between years, with more adult females affected than males.Pteropus conspicillatus are also threatened by mortality from entanglement in backyard drape netting, collision and entanglement in barbed-wire fences, electrocution on power lines, cleft palate and other birth deformities (Richards et al. 2008, Shilton et al. 2008, DERM 2010, J. Maclean pers. comm.).The impact of climate change is unclear but is likely to increase the severity of cyclones and other extreme weather (i.e., heat events) that can kill large numbers and impact the feeding and roosting habitat of the species (DERM 2010). The recent invasion of myrtle rust and tramp ants (electric and yellow crazy ants) into the Wet Tropics region is also a concern for the future status of Wet Tropics species (Metcalfe et al. 2014). In PNG and Indonesia, the range of P. conspicillatus is typically confined to coastal lowlands and islands. These areas are most densely populated by people and subject to the most rapid land use change as documented by remote sensing (Hansen et al. 2013, Stibig et al. 2014). Increasing rates of habitat loss or modification through residential expansion and the clearing of large tracts of forests for expanding oil palm production continue to be a major threat to the species (T. Leary pers. comm.). Logging operations are also expanding in the range of P. conspicillatus, particularly in the West Papua province of Indonesia and the Madang and Morobe provinces of PNG (Stibig et al. 2014). Hunting is another significant threat as flying-foxes are an important food source for many communities and sold as food at local markets (Mack and West 2005, S. Hamilton and T. Leary pers. comm., B. Roberts pers. obs). In both Madang and Lae, P. conspicillatus are hunted and disturbed on an almost daily basis (T. Leary pers. comm, B. Roberts pers. obs.). The impacts of these threats combined with the species\u2019s low reproductive output (Fox et al. 2008) and the population\u2019s low estimated average exponential rate of increase (Westcott et al. 2018) highlight the likelihood of continual decline into the projected future.\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 11.4 Storms & flooding. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 11, Name: 'Climate Change & Severe Weather', Description: 'Threats from long-term climatic changes which may be linked to global warming and other severe climatic/weather events that are outside of the natural range of variation, or potentially can wipe out a vulnerable species or habitat.'\nCode: 11.4, Name: 'Storms & Flooding', Description: 'Extreme precipitation and/or wind events.', Examples: 'thunderstorms, tropical storms, hurricanes, cyclones, tornados, hailstorms, ice storms or blizzards, dust storms, erosion of beaches during storms, etc'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

Habitat fragmentation also causes loss of genetic diversity (Banaszek et al. 2011; Banaszek and Ziomek 2012; La Haye et al. 2012; Neuman et al. 2004, 2005; Reiners et al. 2014). Agricultural intensification\u2014specifically the loss of perennial crops, the lack of crop diversity, large scale monocultural farming, and the use of pesticides\u2014are suspected to have a negative impact. Moreover, it was shown in Alsace that body mass of the hamsters at emergence from hibernation decreased by 20% in the last 70 years. It was suggested that maize monocultures and climate change have such adverse effects on body mass (Tissier et al. 2016). The current change in agricultural practices in Central and Eastern Europe is a real threat in the near future (Hegyeli et al. 2015). In former times, Common Hamster was trapped and poisoned to prevent damage to crops. The hamsters were also trapped for the fur trade (Nechay 2000). A recent analysis of reproduction parameters revealed a global decrease in the number of litters, embryos and newborns to such an extent that the populations potentially might shrink by 50% each year. The reasons for reproduction breakdown most probably are related to climate change, light pollution, or fur trapping in the past (Surov et al. 2016). Light pollution is an often underestimated threat. It acts on the physiology and behaviour of the species through endocrine and neurobiological processes which affect, amongst others, reproduction in birds and mammals (for a review see Navara and Nelson 2007, Gaston et al. 2013). For the Common Hamster there is not only a spatial coincidence between highly light polluted areas and areas with the strongest decline but also a temporal coincidence between the period of decline and increasing light intensities (Surov et al. 2016). Moreover, light exposure during only two winter nights shifted the onset of its reproductive phase by 3-4 weeks (Monecke et al. 2010).

The spread of water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes is a problem in India, as is the siltation of lakes due to catchment deforestation. Pollution of wetlands with pesticides and industrial effluents reduces breeding success. Habitat loss and degradation are compounded by disturbance of wetlands. Reductions in the prey base, primarily through hunting and over-fishing, are further consequences of increasing human pressure. In Myanmar, the development of oil and gas fields is a threat and, in China, hunting is a localised problem (Orta et al. 2020).

Over-fishing was also noted at several sites and low rainfall was leading to falling water levels in some areas (Gilbert and Gombobataar 2009).

Aebischer in litt. 2009); there has been reported a strong correlation between rapid declines and those populations that winter in Spain (Carter 2007). An estimate of 430-1,800 individuals killed illegally in Spain annually indicates that this remains a significant problem for birds that do migrate and for the regional population (Brochet et al. 2016). The Spanish government released more than 1,500 tons of rodenticide-treated baits over about 500,000 ha to fight against a common vole plague in agricultural lands between August 2007 and April 2008; records of Red Kites dying by secondary poisoning in treated areas resulted (J. Vi\u00f1uela in litt. 2009). The total of recovered, confirmed poisoning cases in Spain is 1,187 individuals found dead between 1992 and 2015 (Cano et al. 2016). In north Scotland, 40% of birds found dead between 1989 and 2006 were found to have been killed by poisoning (Smart et al. 2010).In France populations disappeared at the same rate as conversion from grasslands to cereal crops (P. Tourret in litt. 2009). The decline of grazing livestock and farming intensification leading to chemical pollution, homogenization of landscapes and ecological impoverishment also threatens the species (Knott et al. 2009).

The affect these predators have on the overall population trend is unknown.In the western and central part of their range, large-scale agriculture and ranching displaces iguanas and fragments the population. This may reduce their genetic variability to some degree, and may become a future threat with the expansion of human development. Because adult iguanas are currently found in habitats that vary widely in quality (e.g., pristine forests and cities), it is unclear what level of human modification is still compatible with a stable iguana population.In the south, this species hybridizes easily with the Guerreran Spiny-tailed Iguana (Ctenosaura pectinata). It is unknown when these two species started hybridizing, or if human processes have influenced the rate. It is also unknown to what extent the hybrid population outnumbers the pure individuals. Sampling for genetic analysis of these iguanas suggested hybridization in this contact zone may be quite high (Zarza 2008).\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 8.1.2 Named species (Canis familiaris). \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 8, Name: 'Invasive & Other Problematic Species, Genes & Diseases', Description: 'Threats from non-native and native plants, animals, pathogens/microbes, or genetic materials that have or are predicted to have harmful effects on biodiversity following their introduction, spread and/or increase in abundance.'\nCode: 8.1, Name: 'Invasive Non-Native/Alien Species/Diseases', Description: 'Harmful plants, animals, pathogens, and other microbes not originally found within the ecosystem(s) in question and directly or indirectly introduced and spread into it by human activities.'\nCode: 8.1.2, Name: 'Named Species', Description: 'List the specific plant, animal, or microbe e.g., feral domesticated cattle, household pets, zebra mussels, Dutch elm disease or chestnut blight, Miconia tree, introduction of species for biocontrol, chytrid fungus affecting amphibians, etc.'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

Currently, the main threat in its breeding range is the conversion of its habitat to agricultural land, an environment in which crop gathering by combine harvesters causes frequent breeding failure in the species through nest destruction by farm machinery and increased risk of predation by native species (del Hoyo et al. 1994; Berger-Geiger et al. 2019). Intensification on this land increases this threat (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001), as does the increasing tendency for earlier harvest dates (Berger-Geiger et al. 2019). It is commensal with some forms of agriculture, and changes in these practices could leave it potentially vulnerable by depleting its supply of small birds and mammals to prey on (del Hoyo et al. 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is also very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012; Schaub et al. 2020). Higher temperatures and aridity caused by climate change are predicted to reduce nesting success in some areas (Berger-Geiger et al. 2019). It is illegally killed in several European countries (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018).

In Nigeria, a survey of medicinal traders found that Hooded Vulture was the most commonly traded species of vulture, with 90% of all vulture parts traded belonging to the species (Saidu and Buij 2013, Williams et al. 2021a), and both deliberate and unintentional poisoning remains on the increase despite general local awareness (Owolabi et al. 2020). Across West and central Africa the species is one of the most heavily traded, with an estimated 5,850-8,772 individuals traded over a six-year period in West Africa (Buij et al. 2016). Hooded Vulture meat is reportedly sold as chicken in some places (Ogada and Buij 2011, Buij et al. 2016). Trade for vulture parts has almost completely extirpated vultures from parts of their range, for example in Edo State, southern Nigeria (Nosazeogie et al. 2018). In the world's largest vulture poisoning incident to date, more than 2,000 vultures, most of which were Hooded Vultures, were killed in Guinea Bissau at the beginning of 2020, believed to have been driven by demand for body parts for belief-based use (BirdLife International 2020, Henriques et al. 2020). It now appears that there is considerable cross-border trade in vulture parts, with poisoning incidents also recently noted in the Gambia as well as further incidents in Guinea Bissau (D. Ogada in litt. 2022b). Intentional poisoning of vultures may be carried out in some areas by poachers in order to hide the locations of their kills. In 2018 seven Hooded Vultures were killed at an elephant carcass in Mozambique that had been laced with carbofuran by a poacher (SSC 2018), and in 2019 28 Hooded Vultures were killed at three poisoned elephant carcasses in Botswana (BirdGuides 2019). In Senegal vultures receive a form of cultural protection from such killing because they are the totem for some families (B. Bargain in litt. 2016). Secondary poisoning with pesticides at livestock baits being used to poison mammalian predators and feral dogs is also an issue in East Africa (Otieno et al. 2010, C. Kendall in litt. 2012, Roxburgh and McDougall 2012) and parts of West Africa (Mulli\u00e9 et al. 2017). Despite diclofenac being found on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2008) and marketed, it is not thought that this has been directly affecting the species significantly.Declines have also been attributed to land conversion through development and improvements to abattoir hygiene and rubbish disposal in some areas (Ogada and Buij 2011), and, in Senegal, a decline in the number of their favourite nesting tree species (B. Bargain in litt. 2016, Mulli\u00e9 et al. 2017). The species may also be threatened by avian influenza (H5N1), from which it appears to suffer some mortality and which it probably acquires from feeding on discarded dead poultry (Ducatez et al. 2007), although this is not well substantiated (C. Kendall in litt. 2016). In Burkina Faso, the main anthropogenic threats to reproductive output are poaching of eggs, chicks and collection of nesting materials and pruning of nest trees (Dabone et al. 2019). According to questionnaires conducted primarily with abattoir workers in Uganda, electrocution and collision with power lines may be a significant cause of mortality (Magin 2017).\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 7.3 Other ecosystem modifications. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 7, Name: 'Natural System Modifications', Description: 'Threats from actions that convert or degrade habitat in service of managing natural or semi-natural systems, often to improve human welfare.'\nCode: 7.3, Name: 'Other Ecosystem Modifications', Description: 'Other actions that convert or degrade habitat in service of managing natural systems.', Examples: 'land reclamation projects, abandonment of managed lands, riprap along shoreline, mowing grass, tree thinning in parks, beach construction, removal of snags from streams, etc.'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

Feral cats Felis catus depredate chicks and adults. Heavy cat predation was recorded on North Coronado until the mid-1990s (Jehl and Bond 1975, Drost and Lewis 1995). The cat population at Catalina was most recently estimated at 600-750 individuals (Guttila and Stapp 2010) and eradication of cats and rats on the island has been regarded as \u2018not currently feasible\u2019 (Whitworth et al. 2014). Despite this however, many introduced predators have been removed from a number of breeding islands in recent decades (McChesney and Tershy 1998, Keitt 2005, Birt et al. 2012) with post-eradication increases noted (Whitworth and Carter 2017); the eradication of cats on some islands off the coast of western Baja California (Islas Coronado, Todos Santos, San Mart\u00edn and San Benito) in the late-1990s has likely resulted in recent population increases in such localities (Whitworth et al. 2020). Black Rats Rattus rattus prey on murrelet eggs and adults (Whitworth et al. 2014). Eradication of rats at Anacapa Island in 2001\u20132002 greatly improved murrelet hatching success in the following years (2003\u20132010) (Whitworth et al. 2005, 2013), with 191% more eggs hatching and 94% fewer nests being depredated (Newton et al. 2016). Hatching success remains very low on islands including St. Clementine however, a result of ongoing predation by foxes and black rats (Whitworth et al. 2018). House Mice Mus musculus were recently introduced to the Coronados Islands, and Deer Mice Peromyscus maniculatus anacapae (native to nearby Cedros Island) have also been introduced to the San Benito Islands. Deer Mice depredated 46% of all monitored eggs on Santa Barbara (Murray et al. 1983), which is the largest known breeding site for the species (Howard et al. 2014). However, on Anacapa, Deer Mice were established long before the introduction of rats, precluding them from consideration as the cause of declines there (Jones et al. 2005). Another problematic native species is the Barn Owl Tyto alba. Annual estimates of owl predation on Santa Barbara range from 11 to 172 individuals (Thomsen and Harvey 2012, Thomsen et al. 2013, Nur et al. 2013). Population growth modelling based on data collected between 1991 and 2010, resulted in an estimate of a 1.17% population decline owing to owl predation, and projections of a hypothetical 50-80% reduction in predation pressure could potentially result in a 1.15-2.54% positive growth rate, barring an increase in egg depredation from island mouse populations (Nur et al. 2013). This assessment implicated the role of Barn Owls in the suppression of the Scripps\u2019s Murrelet population recovery on Santa Barbara Island although recent evidence suggests that the presence of Barn Owls on Santa Barbara may have an indirect positive influence on Murrelet egg survival through increased predation on deer mice, and resultantly reduced egg predation from the mice themselves (Thomsen and Green 2016). Such interactions however, have been shown to shift with changing El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) rainfall conditions as changing rainfall, vegetation abundance and resultantly deer mouse populations can result in 15-fold increases in the predation of Murrelet by Owls in the absence of mice as a food source (Thomsen et al. 2018). It has recently been evidenced that fecundity is dramatically reduced during drought years due to enhanced egg predation by deer mice and population declines may result (Thomsen and Green 2019). Any increase in the frequency or severity of drought conditions will likely increase the rate of population decline in response. Various forms of pollution are threatening the species. The potential impacts of large and small oil spills in congregation waters near breeding islands is of great concern (Carter et al. 2000, Burkett et al. 2003). Long Beach Harbour is the largest oil port in western North America, with daily arrivals and departures of large oil tankers (USFWS 2005). Frequent oil spills occur in the vicinity of Long Beach Harbour, but most have not affected waters near Catalina (Carter 2003, Whitworth et al. 2014). As stated by Drost and Lewis (1995), pollution from offshore oil-wells or the Los Angeles oil-tanker lane could potentially extirpate the species from the south California Bight. Organochlorine pollutants are considered not to have a current significant effect on murrelets breeding at Catalina, but may have caused reduced reproduction or population size in the past, especially between the 1940s and 1970s, prior to the end of production and dumping of DDT in southern California waters (Drost and Lewis 1995, Whitworth et al. 2014). The potential impacts of bright lights used by squid fishing boats near breeding colonies is another concern, potentially causing disorientation and elevated predation pressures. Many owl-predated murrelets were found during a period of intense inshore squid fishing around Santa Catalina and disturbance from related activities could discourage nest-visitation and possibly cause collision mortalities (Whitworth et al. 2014). Human disturbance has been identified as a cause of nest abandonment and a major threat to the species (Howard et al. 2015). The two highest rates of abandonment on record were observed at the Dock and the Bunkhouse plots, which are directly associated with human structures. The human disturbance associated with these sites may also affect the remaining nesting birds. Machinery operations at the dock include high decibel engine noise and vibration of the dock structure, which along with frequent traffic, could be affecting nesting murrelets beneath the decking of these structures (Howard et al. 2015).Extreme fluctuations of sea surface temperature related to ENSO, are likely to affect food availability for the species, though the impact of such events appears to be small due to their generalist prey (USFWS 2016). In addition, the species's foraging behaviour puts it at risk from gill-net fisheries, although very few incidences have been reported (Carter et al. 2000). No mortality has been reported in nearshore gill-net fisheries in which other seabirds have relatively high bycatch rates (Pacific Seabird Group undated). However, the white seabass gill-net fishery operating around the northern California Channel Islands has very little observer coverage, potentially indicating that bycatch incidence has been underestimated or completely overlooked (Pacific Seabird Group undated).\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 9.2 Industrial & military effluents. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 9, Name: 'Pollution', Description: 'Threats from introduction of exotic and/or excess materials or energy from point and nonpoint sources.'\nCode: 9.2, Name: 'Industrial & Military Effluents', Description: 'Water-borne pollutants from industrial and military sources including mining, energy production, and other resource extraction industries that include nutrients, toxic chemicals and/or sediments.'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].

Demographic models suggest that population declines are primarily driven by loss and fragmentation of non-breeding habitat in Central America (Taylor and Stutchbury 2016).

Aebischer in litt. 2009); there has been reported a strong correlation between rapid declines and those populations that winter in Spain (Carter 2007). An estimate of 430-1,800 individuals killed illegally in Spain annually indicates that this remains a significant problem for birds that do migrate and for the regional population (Brochet et al. 2016). The Spanish government released more than 1,500 tons of rodenticide-treated baits over about 500,000 ha to fight against a common vole plague in agricultural lands between August 2007 and April 2008; records of Red Kites dying by secondary poisoning in treated areas resulted (J. Vi\u00f1uela in litt. 2009). The total of recovered, confirmed poisoning cases in Spain is 1,187 individuals found dead between 1992 and 2015 (Cano et al. 2016). In north Scotland, 40% of birds found dead between 1989 and 2006 were found to have been killed by poisoning (Smart et al. 2010).In France populations disappeared at the same rate as conversion from grasslands to cereal crops (P. Tourret in litt. 2009). The decline of grazing livestock and farming intensification leading to chemical pollution, homogenization of landscapes and ecological impoverishment also threatens the species (Knott et al. 2009). Wind turbines are a potentially serious threat (Duchamp 2003, Mammen et al. 2009, Schaub 2012, P. Tourret in litt. 2009); 18 Red Kite were located having been killed by collisions with windfarms in 2019 (F. David in litt. 2020). Other less significant threats include electrocution and collision with powerlines (Mionnet 2007, P. Tourret in litt. 2009), hunting and trapping (Mionnet 2007, P. Tourret in litt. 2009), road-kills, deforestation, egg-collection (on a local scale) (Ferguson-Lees et al. 2001, Mammen 2007, Cardiel and Vi\u00f1uela 2007). Another factor implicated in the declines in France and Spain is a decrease in the number of rubbish dumps (Mionnet 2007, Cardiel and Vi\u00f1uela 2007).\". \n\nSpecifically, focus on the threat identified as 2.1.3 Agro-industry farming. \nAdditional details about the threat code: \nCode: 2, Name: 'Agriculture & Aquaculture', Description: 'Threats from farming and ranching as a result of agricultural expansion and intensification, including silviculture, mariculture and aquaculture (includes the impacts of any fencing around farmed areas)'\nCode: 2.1, Name: 'Annual & Perennial Non-Timber Crops', Description: 'Crops planted for food, fodder, fibre, fuel, or other uses.'\nCode: 2.1.3, Name: 'Agro-industry Farming'\n\nScope options are:\nWhole (>90%)\nMajority (50-90%)\nMinority (<50%)\n\nSeverity options are:\nVery Rapid Declines\nRapid Declines\nSlow, Significant Declines\nCausing/Could cause fluctuations\nNegligible declines\nNo decline\n\nProvide your answer as a flat Python list, containing only two elements like this: [scope option, severity option].
