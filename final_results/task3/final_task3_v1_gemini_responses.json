However, to get a potentially relevant list, you would need to:**\n\n1. **Consult BirdLife International:** They often have more detailed range maps.\n2. **Contact Local Ornithological Societies:** Organizations in Monaco or nearby France would have the most accurate information on local bird sightings. \n\nRemember, protecting all bird species, regardless of their conservation status, is crucial for a healthy ecosystem. \n",
