The Yellow Cardinal is found in southern Brazil.\n* **Argentina (1):** Very high likelihood. Argentina represents a stronghold for the species.\n* **Venezuela (0.1):** Low likelihood.  While not impossible, it's on the extreme edge of any potential range expansion. \n\n**Important Note:** This is a simplified representation based on general knowledge.

Somalia's climate and environment are not conducive to this species.\n* **Chad (0.2):**  Low likelihood. While the very southern tip of Chad might touch the edge of the species' range, it's not typical habitat.\n* **Uganda (0.9):**  Very high likelihood. Uganda is well within the species' range and has suitable habitats.\n* **Djibouti (0):**  Similar to Somalia, Djibouti's environment is not suitable for this species.\n* **South Sudan (0.7):**  Good likelihood.

A score of 1 reflects this high certainty.\n* **Guatemala (0.2):**  Guatemala is south of the known range, but suitable habitats might exist. There's a small chance, hence the score of 0.2.\n* **All other locations (0):** These locations are geographically distant, separated by oceans or continents, and have unsuitable climates for this frog species. \n",

Assuming the country, the score is 0 as it's not in their range. If it's the US state, the score would be closer to 0.8 (see USA).\n* **Aruba (0.1):** Similar reasoning to Guadeloupe.\n* **United States of America (0.9):** Cliff Swallows are common throughout much of the US during their breeding season.\n* **Guyana (0.2):**  While Guyana is in South America, Cliff Swallows might be spotted there during their wintering in the northern parts of the continent. \n* **Mongolia (0):** Cliff Swallows are not found in Asia.\n\nHere's the Python list representing these likelihoods:\n\n```python\n[0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0, 0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.9, 0.2, 0] \n``` \n",
