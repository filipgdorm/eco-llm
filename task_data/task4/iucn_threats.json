    "threats_description": "There has been massive illegal trade in the species. At least 10,000 birds were taken from the wild in the 1980s, with 50% destined for the Brazilian market (Mittermeier et al. 1990). In 1983-1984, over 2,500 were flown out of Bah\u00eda Negra, Paraguay, with an additional 600 in the late 1980s (J. Pryor in litt. 1998). Although these numbers are now much reduced, illegal trade still continues (e.g. 10 passed through a pet market in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, in August 2004-July 2005, where birds were changing hands for US$ 1,000 and were destined for Peru [Herrera and Hennessey 2007]). More recently it has been noted that there appears to be almost no illegal trade in this species in Bolivia (B. Hennessey in litt. 2012) or Brazil (A. C. Lees in litt. 2015). Across its range, there is some local hunting for food and feathers. In Amazonia, there has been habitat loss for cattle-ranching and hydroelectric power schemes on the rios Tocantins and Xingu. In the Pantanal, only 5% of S. apetala trees have suitable cavities (Guedes 1993, Johnson 1996). Young trees are foraged by cattle and burnt by frequent fires (Newton 1994). The Gerais is being rapidly converted to mechanised agriculture, cattle-ranching and exotic tree plantations (Conservation International 1999). In Paraguay, the species's preferred habitats are regarded as seriously threatened (N. L\u00f3pez de Kochalka in litt. 2013) and Paso Bravo National Park suffers from illegal logging and hunting activity (H. del Castillo in litt. 2014)."

A secondary threat, which may become more significant as habitat loss fragments existing populations, is the illegal local and possibly international cage-bird trade (Beltr\u00e1n 1994, Renjifo et al. 2014, Short and Sharpe 2020). It has moreover been suspected that the species is locally hunted for food, even though this is unconfirmed (Renjifo et al. 2014)."

    "threats_description": "The most significant threat is thought to be the loss of habitat due to urbanization (including light pollution that can cause building collisions, affect the circadian rhythm, and reduce occupation of nesting sites [Camacho and S\u00e1ez-G\u00f3mez 2021]) and due to conversion to agriculture. It is both the loss of breeding areas and destruction of foraging habitat that is impacting the species (Camacho and S\u00e1ez-G\u00f3mez 2021). New renewable energy development, such as photovoltaic plants, are additionally leading to destruction of suitable habitat across Spain (Camacho and S\u00e1ez-G\u00f3mez 2021). In the Algarve region of Portugal the species is declining due to habitat loss and disturbance from the tourist industry (Cleere et al. 2020). Reductions in insect populations due to pesticide use are suspected to have affected the species. Their habit of perching on tarmac in cooler weather makes them vulnerable to collision with vehicles, thought to result in 40-80% of the admissions of the species to wildlife rehabilitation centres in Spain (Cleere et al. 2020, Keller et al. 2020, Camacho and S\u00e1ez-G\u00f3mez 2021). Sampling efforts have additionally shown that species occurring in mining districts (such as the Murcia region) have high blood concentrations of heavy metals (Esp\u00edn et al. 2020, Camacho and S\u00e1ez-G\u00f3mez 2021), albeit the exact impact is unknown. Climate change may be altering fire intensity across much of the breeding range in Spain; although the exact impact also remains unknown.Domestic or feral dogs may affect nesting areas (Camacho and S\u00e1ez-G\u00f3mez 2021). The impacts of predation are poorly documented, but in southern Spain eggs and chicks may be taken by lizards (such as the Ocellated Lizard Timon lepidus), snakes and Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes), but no population impacts are recorded."

    "threats_description": "Less than 0.06% remains of the original old-growth forest cover in the Sierra Madre Occidental ecoregion (Ortiz-Maciel and Cruz-Nieto 2004). Historically, there has been an extensive modification of old-growth pine forests for timber and woodpulp. In the Sierra Madre Occidental, 80-85% of forest cover remains, but only 0.6% is old-growth (Lammertink et al. 1996). In 1994, there was extensive penetration and degradation of habitat in south Chihuahua by drug-growers, loggers and huge numbers of cattle. In the same year, forest stands at Mesa de Guacamayas were heavily burned (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). Logging has been intensive in the Sierra Madre Occidental, with no large fragments of old growth forest remaining in northern areas (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). Commercial logging in the area involves the removal of larger trees and standing dead wood, and appears to reduce nest-site availability by leaving few snags and pine trees large enough for the species to nest in. Such large-scale logging operations across the species's historic range may be responsible for its decline (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). As a result of habitat loss, the breeding strongholds are now concentrated in two areas; Cebadillas de Yahuirachi and Madera (Monterrubio-Rico et al. 2006). Fire remains a serious threat to the species (M. A. Cruz-Nieto et al. in litt. 2007). Illegal trade in the species has fluctuated with peaks in the early 1970s and mid-1980s. Unofficial records confirm that the species is taken for illegal trade, but the extent of trapping is not known (M. A. Cruz-Nieto et al. in litt. 2007). Climate change may have an impact on habitat availability for this species, particularly during the breeding season: depending on the climate change scenario, the climatically suitable area for the species may shrink to only 25-70% of the current extent by 2090 (Monterrubio-Rico et al. 2015)."

Remaining habitat, however, is grazed which may be a potential threat. Nesting habitat has been destroyed, and regeneration prevented, by timber logging, firewood collection, ringbarking, increasing salinisation and waterlogging. In some areas, feral honeybees and Galah Eolophus roseicapilla compete for remaining available hollows. A small proportion of the population is exposed to poison, shooting, and when feeding on split grain, traffic accidents (Garnett and Crowley 2000)."

    "threats_description": "While fires in 2019\u20132020 probably killed some birds, Flame Robin abundance is positively associated with the proportion of the landscape burnt, but they move away once vegetation recovers (Loyn 1980, 1985; Lindenmayer et al. 2014). Although breeding in upland areas, the relationship with climate change is complex with birds tending to arrive later at the highest altitudes (Green 2006, 2010). Although they are more common in regions retaining a high percentage of remnant native vegetation (Barrett et al. 2007), they preferentially occupy grassy mountain tops or areas with more open spaces and less understorey (Robinson 1990a,b, 1992a,b). No studies link historical clearing, cultivation, over-grazing and other historical and ongoing degradation of non-breeding habitat to robin population trends. Some peri-urban habitats ceased to attract wintering Flame Robins when they were no longer used for grazing cattle. The overall decline between atlases, which now appears to have ceased, and the reason for recent declines in Tasmania warrant investigation."

    "threats_description": "Nest predation by Sugar Gliders Petaurus breviceps introduced to Tasmania poses a severe threat (Stojanovic et al. 2014) and is estimated to cause severe declines over the next three generations (Heinsohn et al. 2015). Surveys revealed that Sugar Gliders predated nests and the probability of a nest surviving the 60-day nesting period when Sugar Gliders were present was 0.17 (Stojanovic et al. 2014). On mainland Tasmania almost 79% nests were predated and 65% of adult females were killed by Sugar Gliders. Predation was most severe in locations with low forest cover. Owing to the fact that Swift Parrot breeding distribution varies widely between years the extent of nest predation is also expected to vary annually depending on the distribution of Sugar Gliders and forest cover. Sugar Gliders have not been reported from Bruny Island, a Swift Parrot breeding site.Habitat loss and alteration within breeding and drought refuge habitats remains a key threat. In Tasmania, breeding habitat is significantly reduced and fragmented through clearance of E. globulus for agriculture, residential development, plantation timber, sawlog production and clear-felling for woodchips. In 2017, a large area of key nesting habitat has been logged for timber extraction (D. Stojanovic in litt. 2017). Over 50% of the original grassy E. globulus forest in Tasmania has been cleared (Brereton et al. 2004). Selective logging has resulted in the removal of larger trees from the remaining forest patches. Such patches are typically unfenced and exhibit poor regeneration (Brereton et al. 2004). Competition for remaining nest-sites with Common Starlings Sturnus vulgaris could be a problem along forest edges. Even with protection of remaining habitat (80% private land), maintenance and recovery may be limited by the dependence of breeding on an irregular nectar supply. It also suffers high mortality through collision with windows, vehicles and fences. On the mainland, clearance and degradation of habitat for agriculture, forestry and residential and commercial development has had the biggest impact (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). Much of the preferred lowland habitat on the most fertile and productive sites has been cleared or substantially modified (C. Tzaros in litt. 2003). Drought refuge habitats continue to be cleared and fragmented for coastal developments (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). Remnants, including much of what currently exists in the conservation reserve system, have been heavily cut-over and degraded, and this practice is continuing in many areas, including hardwood production forests. This practice is considered to result in poor and unreliable nectar-sources through the reduction of large mature trees. Competition from large nectarivores honeyeaters and the introduced Bumblebee Bombus terrestris may be exacerbated by forest fragmentation. In winter, the species relies heavily on public land that has been exploited for timber, honey and minerals (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005). Global warming threatens to alter habitat phenology and climatic conditions such that habitat availability may be significantly reduced (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). The species is also threatened by disturbance, Psittacine beak and feather disease and illegal bird capture and trade (D. Saunders in litt. 2007). Furthermore, the species seems to be very susceptible to Allee effects, where survival and reproductive success decline with decreasing population density, which might even accelerate the population decline (Crates et al. 2017)."

    "threats_description": "Up until its partial protection in the early 1970s, over 150,000 were shot in a bounty scheme, established because rogue individuals were found to be attacking sheep as a source of fat. Deforestation for pasture has placed pressure on the species, and farmers still kill an unknown number of birds each year (Mosen 2009). Introduced mammalian predators such as stoats Mustela erminea, cats and brush-tailed possums Trichosurus vulpecula have spread into most of the species's range. Episodic, high mortality events are thought to be associated with \u201cplagues\u201d of stoats Mustela erminea which occur after mast seeding of native beech and rimu (Kemp 2013). Monitoring by the Department of Conservation between 2009-2014 found that only 2% of kea nests in areas without pest control were successful, in contrast with a 27% success rate in areas treated with aerial 1080 in 2015 (Department of Conservation 2016). It is estimated that around 60% of kea nests are normally attacked by predators, especially stoats, which may also kill adults; this can rise to as many as 99% of nests being attacked in a stoat \u201cplague\u201d (Department of Conservation 2016). Birds are sometimes killed through accidents with human objects (e.g. motor vehicles, snow groomers, rubbish bins, electricity sub-stations) (Orr-Walker et al. 2015). Ingestion of lead from building components and the 1080 toxin used in invasive control have potentially widespread impacts on the population (T. Orr-Walker in litt. 2008; Reid et al. 2012; Orr-Walker 2013a; van Klink &amp; Crowell 2015). Climate change may pose a threat through possible future influences on its high altitude habitat (Mosen 2009)."

    "threats_description": "There is no clear reason for declines in either Southern Whiteface subspecies, except in that part of the range where there has been complete removal of habitat for intensive agriculture. A study in Victoria found no effect of habitat fragment area, isolation, fragmentation, quality or complexity (Maron and Lill 2005). A. l. castaneiventris is largely absent from areas with intensive agriculture, but declines have occurred both there and in extensive use rangelands in the east as well as intensive use areas. Droughts may have local impacts (Ellis and Taylor 2014) and are likely to become more frequent and severe (Evans et al. 2017). Modelling suggests optimal climatic conditions for the species will retract to the south (Garnett and Franklin 2014) because of rainfall reductions (Garnett et al. 2013). However, whitefaces live in some of the driest and hottest parts of the country, yet they have declined in places that are generally far wetter."

In fragmented habitats, breeding pairs suffer from lower reproductive success and higher prevalence of cowbird parasitism (Evans et al. 2020). Demographic models suggest that population declines are primarily driven by loss and fragmentation of non-breeding habitat in Central America (Taylor and Stutchbury 2016). Further threats include contamination by acid rain, disturbance at nest sites, pollution and window collisions (Evans et al. 2020)."

    "threats_description": "There is no obvious explanation for the population decline, although some threats to the Orange-bellied Parrot N. chrysogaster (DELWP 2016) may also apply to this species. In Tasmania, land clearing for agriculture continues to remove habitat given that up to 40 ha can now be cleared without a permit (FPA 2020), nesting birds may be subject to excessive predation by introduced sugar gliders Petaurus breviceps (Stojanovic et al. 2014). Cats Felis catus (Woinarski et al. 2017) and, on the mainland, foxes Vulpes vulpes may take some birds given they feed on the ground. Fire may have affected some birds as may drought, with both expected to increase in severity and frequency (Evans et al. 2017, Di Virgilio et al. 2019, Dowdy et al. 2019), which may also have contributed to declines. Although droughts have probably reduced productivity of coastal saltmarsh and other habitats used in the non-breeding season, recent fires may have attracted birds to breed in areas where they are less likely to be observed (Boon et al. 2011, Boon 2012). Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease may also have reduced survival and reproductive success (Raidal and Peters 2018)."

    "threats_description": "Clearance of native vegetation, which continues (EES 2019), is the underlying reason for the decline of the species. There is also widespread degradation of habitat that remains (Ford 2011) which has led to the replacement of native perennial grasses with exotic annual grasses, resulting in starvation of the firetails during periods when exotic annual grass seed germinates in autumn and winter if there are no alternative seed sources (Higgins et al. 2007, Hodder 2019). Habitat patches are also degraded by grazing stock, rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and kangaroos Macropus spp. that remove the shrub layer (Barrett et al. 2002). Firetails are also more likely to persist in a matrix of sheep grazing, a land-use that has been declining (ABARES 2020), than where surrounding areas are grazed by cattle or sown to grain crops (Barrett et al. 2002). Factors that have been postulated to be adversely affecting this species in particular include the loss of key food plants and habitat as a result of invasion by exotic grasses more suitable for flock-foraging Red-browed Finch Neochmia temporalis, whose expansion in some areas may have disadvantaged S. guttata. In the north of the range, a change in fire and grazing regimes may have played an important part in the decline. Isolated subpopulations may be susceptible to illegal trapping."

    "threats_description": "Range contraction is largely the result of clearing for agriculture. Decreases in the species's abundance are linked to land clearing that does not leave scattered trees in the landscape (Manning et al. 2007). Remaining habitat is often fragmented, with feeding and breeding habitats divided. Regeneration is commonly prevented by high grazing levels by stock and rabbits or inappropriate fire regimes. Scattered box-gum woodland is threatened by limited regeneration, rural tree dieback, removal of trees and firewood collection (Manning et al. 2007). In breeding areas the majority of nest trees are often on private land, with scattered paddock trees in mixed agricultural land of vital importance on the South-West Slopes. Nest-site fidelity means that birds continue to use traditional breeding sites despite habitat loss and degradation (Leslie 2005). Many nest trees are dead, particularly on inland slopes, and have no replacements when they fall or are cut for firewood, potentially resulting in competition with other species, particularly the Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris. There are limited provisions for the protection of dead trees, and due to continued illegal removal and natural loss of old trees a decline in nest site availability is inevitable (Manning et al. 2004). In areas of low occupancy, the availability of food in the breeding season, and not that of nest hollows, may limit population size (Leslie 2005). In the Riverina, altered flooding regimes may compromise the health and extent of riparian woodlands where this species nests (C. Tzaros and M. A. Weston in litt. 2003). Illegal trapping occurs, but is a far less significant threat than habitat loss. Birds are also killed on roadsides and possibly suffer from pesticide poisoning. The abundance and distribution of the species appears to be affected by changes in plant productivity, as influenced by climate (Manning et al. 2007). It is therefore susceptible to climate change and its interaction with fragmentation (Manning et al. 2007)."

    "threats_description": "Several ideas have been presented that may account for declines in this species (see Lymn and Temple 1991), including pesticides (Anderson and Duzan 1978), fire ant presence in wintering habitats (Lymn and Temple 1991), West Nile Virus (Bertelsen et al. 2004, Smallwood and Nakomoto 2009) and habitat fragmentation and loss, particularly through conversion to agricultural land. The Loggerhead Shrike has been evidenced to be significantly more abundant in better connected areas of suitable habitat (Froehly et al. 2019) whilst occupancy significantly increases in areas with greater than 15-25% habitat suitability (A. Chabot in litt. 2020). Migratory connectivity is known to be greater in western L. ludovicianus populations where the impacts of habitat loss on populations are thought to be reduced, hence western populations may be at comparatively less risk than eastern populations (Chabot et al. 2018). Habitat loss and fragmentation are therefore thought to only be of regional significance, hence in other locations additional factors must be responsible for limiting Loggerhead Shrikes and driving the witnessed declines (Brooks and Temple 1990, Froehly et al. 2019). The species may have also been persecuted and shot in the past, but this has likely reduced (Yosef 1996). While the use of certain pesticides is now prohibited in U.S.A. the potential effects of other threats may be likely to continue into the future (Pruitt 2000, COSEWIC 2014). Collisions with vehicles contribute to the species's decline as roads display a number of essential habitat features; 29% of all L. ludovicianus winter mortality in Virginia has been attributed to collisions on roads (Blumton 1989). Furthermore, intraspecific competition on wintering grounds between migrants and resident shrikes that occupy territories year round likely contributes to the decline of obligant migrant populations of Loggerhead Shrike in north-eastern North America (Brooks and Temple 1990; Cade and Woods 1997; Pruitt 2000; COSEWIC 2000). Loss of habitat in wintering areas may exacerbate competition (Lymn and Temple 1991). Extreme local weather conditions have been implicated in declines as a result of high nest failure rates (e.g., nest abandonment or loss of young birds during cold wet breeding seasons, especially with heavy rains [Pruitt 2000]) and such threats may increase as stormy conditions are exacerbated under a changing global climate (COSEWIC 2014, Environment Canada 2015a). Predation of shrikes by a variety of species, including cats, raccoons, crows, magpies, and several raptors has been observed (Blumton 1989; Wiggins 2004) but the significance has not been evaluated. Predation by feral cats (Felis catus) impacts the endemic subspecies L. l. mearnsi on San Clemente Island, California, U.S.A. (Gustafson et al. 2020)."

    "threats_description": "Agricultural conversion and over cattle-grazing of natural grasslands are the principal threats to remaining populations in Argentina (Di Giacomo and Krapovickas 2002, Clay et al. in prep.). Early declines in the Pampas of Argentina were caused by the spread of corn, wheat and soybean monocultures (Di Giacomo and Di Giacomo 2004). Later declines in the central Chaco of Argentina were caused by the establishment of cotton crops (Di Giacomo and Di Giacomo 2004). In Corrientes and Formosa, cattle ranching has not caused critical modifications of natural grasslands. However, spring and summer fires for improving pastures affects reproductive success in Corrientes (A. S. Di Giacomo and A. G. Di Giacomo in litt. 2007). Other short-term threats come from the spread of soybean and rice crops, and pine and Eucalyptus plantations in some traditional cattle ranching areas (Di Giacomo and Di Giacomo 2004). In Corrientes, afforestation with Eucalyptus and Pinus spp., encouraged by government incentives (Di Giacomo and Krapovickas 2002, Clay et al. in prep.), is even affecting wet valley bottoms since trees are often planted adjacent to, or within, inundated grasslands, regardless of their subsequent poor growth and unsuitability for the market (R. Davies verbally 1998). In Paraguay the main threats are loss of grassland habitats for afforestation with Eucalyptus, cattle ranching and the introduction of invasive grasses, and excessive burning. Conversion of wetlands and grasslands for rice fields is a rapidly increasing threat in Eastern Paraguay (H. del Castillo in litt. 2007). Its preference for tall grasses makes it intolerant of even biannual burning (Di Giacomo et al. 2011). Pesticides, fertilisers and other chemicals are widely used and must have profound effects on suitable grasslands (Clay et al. in prep.). It is apparently not disturbed by extensive cattle ranching (H. del Castillo in litt. 2007)."

Collisions with moving vehicles may be a contributing factor, but persecution as a pest by farmers and utility companies is currently minimal (Smith et al. 2000, del Hoyo et al. 2002). Mortality events due to collisions with communication towers have been reported (Longcore et al. 2013), but the overall threat from this is unknown. The introduced Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris may also be a threat as they act as competitors for nest sites with Red-headed Woodpeckers (J. Berl in litt. 2016). Additionally, predation by the Sharp-shinned Hawk Accipiter striatus and warmer winter temperatures might play a role in the decline of the Red-headed Woodpecker (Koenig et al. 2017)."

In California potential threats may include harvesting of Joshua trees and other yuccas, overgrazing and off-road vehicle activity. However, there have been suggestions that clearing and agricultural activities actually favour this species (England and Laudenslayer 1993). Competition with the Curve-billed Thrasher Toxostroma curvirostre for a depleted food supply may have contributed to a decline in the population. Breeding is delayed and potentially less successful as a result of drought conditions (McCreedy and van Ripper III 2015), which may increase in line with climate change, and thus this could be a significant threat into the future. Energy/resource extraction is also listed in Rosenberg et al. (2016) as a potential threat to this species with alternative energy development occurring in the Sonoran desert."

The application of pesticides has \"greatly reduced\" the populations of insects in intensively farmed areas of northern Italy, and Luppi et al. (2020) attribute declines in the lizard to the loss of insect prey as well as the destruction of its habitat. The causes of decline in the subpopulation studied by Guiller et al. (in press) are not clear from the variables included in their model, although they \"appeared related to hedgerow loss\" and the species was more frequently found in sites with dense hedgerows. It is also possible this species was already in decline at the start of the survey period following the loss of previously favourable habitat (Guiller et al. in press). Clearance of vineyards and river widening, the latter associated with the removal of embankments, dry stone walls and other key habitat structure, is the main threat in Germany and was most pronounced between the 1960s and 1980s (Rote-Liste-Gremium Amphibien und Reptilien 2020). In the Rhineland-Palatinate region the population has recently undergone decline due to these factors as well as increasing hillside development for tourist and urban facilities, and the further isolation of these small subpopulations due to development activities and construction of noise barriers along railway lines (Rote-Liste-Gremium Amphibien und Reptilien 2020)."

Animals have however been observed to alter their response to predators with varying temperature conditions, suggesting that even with a changing climate in the future, Ctenophorus isolepis may be able to balance thermoregulation and predator avoidance (Losos 1988)."

Habitat loss in southern Russia driven by overgrazing and agriculture is ongoing and has fragmented the population in this area (K. Milto pers. comm. 2016). It survives in only around 7 localities in the Rostov region (K. Milto pers. comm. 2016). Additional pressures in parts of its Caucasian range exist from ongoing intensive agricultural development and the associated use of pesticides that may deplete food resources, burning of grassland and shrubby vegetation, urban development and direct persecution (Doronin 2013a,b)."

As such habitat fragmentation - which is largely either natural or historical - should not be considered a major threat at this time, and the population does not qualify as severely fragmented. Rock is directly extracted from some outcrops for construction and landscaping, but this appears to be the only direct impact on its habitat."

In the European portion of its range, declines in cattle grazing have resulted in dunes becoming more heavily-vegetated, eliminating suitable microhabitat for this species. Clennan et al. (2010) list general threats to vegetated desert habitats in the Kyzyzlkum region from overgrazing, increasing soil salinity, desertification and firewood extraction, but do not identify these as specific threats to this lizard. It is targeted for the international pet trade, and this may lead to localized overharvesting particularly in Dagestan, especially the Sary Kum sand dune. Habitat loss and fragmentation due to urban development, forest restoration and tourism represent threats in China. Collection for the pet trade could have a large, but localized, impact on this species.CN\uff1a\u53d7\u57ce\u9547\u5efa\u8bbe\u3001\u6c99\u6f20\u65c5\u6e38\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e5f\u53d7\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u5ba0\u7269\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd"

Since the species is a lotic habitat specialist that inhabits running waters in free flowing rivers with rocky bottoms, it does not thrive in lentic stillwater reservoirs and impoundments; significant mortality is sustained by individual turtles falling from high dams while attempting to leave reservoirs (Kunz et al. 2018). See the 'Use and Trade' section for additional threats."

    "threats_description": "Based on information obtained since the withdrawal of the proposed listing rule in 1997 and information documented in the proposed rule, USFWS (2003) identified potential threats to the Flat-tailed Horned Lizard, including the following: urban development, agricultural development, OHV activity, energy development, military activities, introduction of non-native plants, pesticide use, and habitat degradation due to Border Patrol and illegal drive-through traffic along the United States-Mexico border. These threats and their effects on flat-tailed horned lizards and their habitat are discussed in further detail in USFWS (2003). After considering all the current available information, USFWS (2003) determined that the threats identified under Factor A (habitat loss/change) were not significant enough to conclude that the Flat-tailed Horned Lizard is likely to become endangered throughout all or a significant portion of its range in the foreseeable future. However, the Coachella Valley has experienced a significant amount of habitat curtailment and there is the potential for significant habitat destruction in the immediate future, because of the predominant private ownership of habitat and the rate of development in the Coachella Valley. Currently available information does not suggest that development of private lands on the west side of Salton Sea/Imperial Valley poses a threat in the foreseeable future. The only towns in this geographic area are Borrego Springs, Ocotillo, Ocotillo Wells, and Salton City. The largest of these towns is Borrego Springs with a population of approximately 3,000 people. It is likely that the size of these towns will not change significantly in the foreseeable future (USFWS 2003). Therefore, USFWS (2003) concluded that the threat of development of private lands in areas other than the Coachella Valley is not significant enough to endanger the species within the foreseeable future throughout a significant portion of its range. The available data do not suggest that habitat modification by OHV use threatens the Flat-tailed Horned Lizard on the west side of the Salton Sea/Imperial Valley and east side of the Imperial Valley (USFWS 2003). USFWS (2003) also concluded that the Arizona population is not likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future. The low percentage of lands in private ownership makes for a low degree of threat from development. Further, OHV use has not been shown to be a threat to populations there, and this geographic area experiences a relatively low level of OHV activity. Collection, predation, and disease are not believed to be significant threats (USFWS 2003). In Mexico, off-road driving by tourists over dunes is a major threat to its habitat. The species is also persecuted, and is harvested for the pet trade in Mexico."

    "threats_description": "In Portugal the species' subpopulations are isolated and vulnerable to habitat loss (Brito 2008), which is also the case for the marginal subpopulation in France and for some Spanish subpopulations (Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda 2015, Brito 2021); extinction for some French isolates was predicted by Saint-Girons (1989). The main driver of habitat loss is agricultural intensification and mechanisation which removes hedgerows and stone walls, the development of pine and eucalypt plantations and associated wildfire (e.g. in Galicia and northern Portugal), and the deliberate burning of scrub (summarised by Brito 2021), and in some areas (e.g. Navarra) infrastructure development (Bra\u00f1a 2002).Southern Europe is predicted to experience particularly extreme climate warming (up to 10 \u00b0C in some areas) by 2100 and increasing aridity (IPCC 2013). Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda et al. (2015) conducted climate modelling (IPCC scenarios a1b, a2 and b1, ranging from 'business as usual' to optimistic projections - Carter 2007) using niche-based models at the scale of 1 x 1 km. His results suggest that, while stable refugia will persist in most of the northwest Iberian Peninsula, these will increasingly be confined to high-elevation mountains and the species' distribution is likely to decline drastically by 2050 and especially by 2080, becoming highly fragmented by the latter time point (Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda 2015). The area of suitable habitat within the species' range is predicted to fall by 73.51\u201377.24 by 2050, and by approximately 93\u201395 compared with a 2015 baseline (Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda et al. 2015). There is a high probability that this will increase the isolation at the species' southwest margin (where genetic diversity is greatest) and will likely result in local extinctions, increasing population isolation and likely promoting inbreeding (F. Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda pers. comm. 2023). Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda et al. (2015) cautions that data on dispersal were unavailable to incorporate into the model, but this and related species are believed to have low vagility. Despite the caveats associated with applying ecological niche models to climate modelling (discussed by Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda et al. 2015), this author notes that the results are consistent with expectations for a temperate snake associated with humid microhabitats, as its favoured conditions presently occur over a relatively narrow range in the northern Iberian Peninsula and are expected to become rarer.The species is subject to direct mortality primarily from persecution, but secondarily (and potentially significantly at local levels - Brito and \u00c1lvares 2004, Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda and Brito 2012) from roadkill (Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda and Brito 2014, Brito 2021)."

These activities have fragmented forest habitat and may affect the foraging and breeding habitats of Calotes emma (Majumder and Agarwala 2015). Deforestation and shifting cultivation also represent localized impacts elsewhere in the range, including Myanmar, and there is also pressure in this country from oil palm plantations in which the species will not persist. In China, the species has been hunted for traditional medicine and the pet trade, but it is not a species in high demand."

In India it was encountered in 22 of 35 markets surveyed before 1983 (Vijaya 1982, Moll 1983), and in 7 of 61 markets surveyed in 1991\u20131993 (Choudhury and Bhupathy 1993), being the most commonly traded turtle in both periods. Trade continued to the present day, with Lissemys punctata making up 50\u201360% of all turtles confiscated in markets (Choudhury et al. 2000). Much of exploitation is for subsistence and local trade for consumption, but some export has taken place from India and Bangladesh to East Asia (Choudhury et al. 2000, Rashid and Khan 2000, Bhupathy et al. 2000). Lissemys punctata is also used for a number of purposes in traditional medicine. A total of well over 2,300 live specimens, in 13 shipments, were reported as seized from illegal trade during the period 2000\u20132015 (CITES CoP17 Doc73). Legal International pet trade levels are minimal. Wetland loss has been significant in parts of the species' range, while urbanisation of nesting sites and construction of dams may also impact L. punctata."

    "threats_description": "Sri Lanka has suffered severe deforestation due to human activities including the clearing of land for agricultural purposes, conversion to plantation land, mining, logging and pressures associated with expanding human settlements. In 2005 it was estimated that only 5% of the island's original wet zone rainforest, where this species occurs, remained (Bahir and Surasinghe 2005). Habitat loss and further fragmentation is the primary threat to this species, with extensive development of the wet zone for major roads - including flood barriers which inhibit water flow and have resulted in flooding of forest fragments, which destroys oviposition sites and causes landslides - and hydropower, agricultural and urban development. Historically, this species was able to tolerate the light habitat modification associated with Sri Lankan home gardens, large plots generally with some natural forest and large trees. Increased human population density has reduced the area and and altered the management of traditional home gardens, which have largely been replaced with houses, tea plantations and smaller gardens, and populations of human commensals such as cats are increasing. Home garden habitat is unlikely to be suitable for the long term persistence of this species, restricting it to increasingly fragmentary, highly threatened forest fragments. Compared with records from natural habitats, animals from home gardens recorded by Karunarathna and Amarasinghe (2013) exhibited more common signs of physical injury, possibly as a result of predation attempts.The lizard is reliant on large trees in natural, home garden and plantation situations, and is threatened by anything that removes these. Logging is intense within its range, including within forest reserves, and as a predominantly lowland species it is impacted heavily by land clearance for tea plantations. Almost all subpopulations are confined to small fragments of good habitat; the only substantial areas of continuous forest within its range lie in the Sinharaja Biosphere Reserve and the Knuckles Conservation Forest, and both areas are subject to some degree of encroachment for settlements and agriculture, while tourist activities and infrastructure represent an additional pressure in parts of these ranges (especially in the Knuckles).High levels of soil erosion have been observed even within Sinharaja rainforest, and rates are increasing as a result of more frequent extreme weather events. More variable weather, including higher-than-average rainfall during the monsoon season and extended dry periods, are likely to strongly affect this species. The lizard lays eggs less than a centimetre deep in soil, and both soil erosion during periods of high rainfall and soil desiccation during drought may destroy eggs, as well as resulting in elevated adult mortality and habitat degradation. Drought also defoliates trees, especially in the northern and eastern parts of the range, reducing shade and increasing animals' exposure to predation, The ecological study conducted by Karunarathna and Amarasinghe (2013) found that this species appears to favour areas with high rainfall and a narrow temperature range, and so any deviation from these conditions is likely to degrade its habitat. Extinction of isolated subpopulations, especially in the intermediate zone, is considered highly likely in the near future (M. Wickramasinghe and S. Kannishka pers. comm. 2019). While mo quantitative data is available, observations by researchers who commonly work within its range estimate that encounter rates are about 70% of those 10 years ago (M. Wickramasinghe and S. Kannishka pers. comm. 2019).This species is also of interest to the international pet industry (Shiau et al. 2006). While a proposal for CITES Appendix I listing in 2019 concluded that numbers involved are too low to represent a major threat, and describes traders as being interested in but unable to obtain animals, there is a widespread perception among Sri Lankan herpetologists that the high demand for this species - evidenced by the high prices it commands in the international pet trade - is a cause for concern, and there appears to have been at least one instance of successful smuggling within the last two or three years. There is also some level of persecution, due to a traditional belief that this lizard sucks human blood (P. Samarawickrama pers. comm. 2019)."

Thick cover of non-native grasses degrades the habitat in some years and locations (Germano and Williams 2005). These lizards use mammal burrows for shelter, so activities that compact soil or crush burrows should be avoided. Habitat disturbance, destruction, and fragmentation continue as the greatest threats to Blunt-nosed Leopard Lizard populations (USFWS 1998)."

    "threats_description": "Although this species is generally still abundant in noninvaded parts of the island, it is impacted by predation by feral cats and rats. Lizards of the genus Gallotia appear to represent an important secondary prey item for feral cats in areas where the lizards are abundant (Nogales and Medina 2009).The California Kingsnake was introduced to Gran Canaria in 1998 (Cabrera-P\u00e9rez et al. 2012), and has now become established in areas of the North, East and South zones of the island (Piquet and L\u00f3pez-Darias 2021). Piquet and L\u00f3pez-Darias (2021) found that the lizard was now absent from 86% of invaded sites in these areas, and most of the invaded sites where lizards survived were at the edge of the snake's invasive range. The snake is known to prey on the Gran Canaria Giant Lizard (Monz\u00f3n-Arg\u00fcello et al. 2015), and this is presumably the mechanism driving declines. The greater severity of observed impacts of snake invasion on this lizard compared with the island's other two native lizards may reflect its diurnal habits (Piquet and L\u00f3pez-Darias 2021), as the California Kingsnake's diet in its native range consists largely of diurnal, surface-active lizards (Wiseman et al. 2019). Surviving animals in invaded regions are disproportionately large animals that are likely to have grown to maturity before snakes invaded these sites, suggesting that recruitment following invasion is negligible or non-existent, and the lizard is no longer found in the longest-invaded areas (Piquet et al. 2022). It is consequently likely that the species will become extinct in invaded sites in the absence of strong immigration from uninvaded areas (Piquet et al. 2022). No evidence of morphological adaptation has been found following snake invasion, suggesting that the species will be unable to adapt in time to prevent its extinction from much of Gran Canaria (Piquet et al. 2022).The introduced snake is now found across more than 50% of the island (based on records taken between 2009 and 2020; Piquet et al. 2022) and its range is still expanding, but may not colonise uplands/cliff areas (M.A. Carretero pers. comm. October 2022). Records taken since 2020 suggest that either the snake's occurrence was strongly underestimated or that it continues to expand rapidly, and it may now be present over more than 60% of the island (M.A. Carretero pers. comm. 2022). Although its occurrence is currently sporadic in much of the western half of the island, it is largely continuous across the northeast and parts of the south, with scattered but widespread occurrences elsewhere in the east and southwest (Piquet et al. 2022). The snake is projected to benefit from climate change, and expand into areas that are presently unsuitable (Piquet et al. 2021). Although the lizard has already been lost from large portions of its range, the accompanying map codes Gran Canaria as 'Extant' as the available data are not at a resolution sufficient to accurately map areas where it is now extinct (M.A. Carretero pers. comm. 2022)."

It is listed as vulnerable in the Northern Territory as it is very susceptible to the toxins produce by the cane toad (Ward et al. 2006). An 18-month study at Manton Dam Recreation Area reported evidence of rapid decline in both abundance and site occupancy of this species eight months after cane toads reached this area, and an overall decline in abundance by nearly 80% between December 2004 and May 2006 (Griffiths and McKay 2007); comparable rates of decline (84-93%) within three years of the Cane Toad's arrival have been reported in subsequent multi-year studies of newly-colonized sites in the Northern Territory (Doody et al. 2009, 2014), and of almost 41% over a comparable period in Kununurra in the northeastern Kimberley (Doody et al. 2015). Almost the entirety of this species' range lies within the predicted range of the cane toad, with the possible exception only of several offshore islands. The toad is expected to invade around 80% of this monitor lizard's distribution within three generations (dated from the year 2000)."

Long-term impacts of climate change have the potential to be catastrophic (DSE 2011) for this subspecies, due to its reliance on moist microhabitats. Habitat fragmentation has occurred at most sites where this subspecies is found as a result of processes such as vegetation clearing, rock removal and the drainage of wetlands (DSE 2011). Predation by feral cats may also be a threat (DSE 2011)."

It is not threatened on Trinidad and Tobago. At least 68% of the range in Brazil is still covered in original vegetation types, based on data from 2008. Habitat loss in concentrated in the southern portion of the range in Brazil, mainly in Atlantic Forest and Cerrado areas. The species seems to persist even is these densely occupied areas. The subspecies Boa constrictor ortoni has a very restricted range in southern Ecuador and northern Peru and it is being affected by habitat loss and human persecution (D.

    "threats_description": "The Veracruz Spiny-tailed Iguana is primarily threatened by habitat fragmentation and destruction caused by human activities (oil extraction, urbanization, agriculture, and cattle ranching). Forests are logged everywhere throughout their range. Large-scale agriculture and ranching displaces iguanas and fragments the population. This may reduce their genetic variability to some degree, and may become a future threat with the expansion of human development. Clearing forests and road building for these activities also provides easier access to iguanas for hunters.In regions where they are not hunted, these iguanas have a certain tolerance to semi-urbanized areas (small villages and isolated houses), even taking advantage of them (e.g., foraging around crops, using fence posts and walls as retreats). However, in these areas iguanas are threatened by feral and free-roaming cats and dogs, and this is likely to impact the survival of hatchlings and juveniles in particular; dogs prey on all age classes. The affect these predators have on the overall population trend is unknown (Su\u00e1rez-Dom\u00ednguez et al. 2013)."

    "threats_description": "This species is threatened by loss of habitat through agricultural intensification, forest increase, and to a lesser degree loss of habitat resulting from the development of tourist facilities and urbanisation (Jaggi and Baur 1999). The species is often found in open areas and overgrowth of these sites is an additional threat (for example in the Jura Mountains; Jaggi and Baur 1999). The species is persecuted by people and illegally collected for the pet trade. It does not seem to be at major risk in the Iberian Peninsula and may have benefitted from the abandonment of traditional agricultural land which has likely reduced its exposure to persecution (Gos\u00e1 2002), however, habitat loss due to agricultural intensification and the development of tourist and urban infrastructure represent threats and it is locally sensitive to mortality from traffic and direct persecution (Mart\u00ednez-Freir\u00eda 2021). In France, while historical data are lacking it is likely that there was a past decline due to high levels of persecution (including a bounty system which encouraged people to kill the animal in very large numbers) (P.-A. Crochet pers. comm. 2022). The bounty system has been discontinued, and it is unknown whether persecution is an ongoing threat in France (P.-A. Crochet pers. comm. 2022).The decline in Italy's Tolfa Mountains is correlated with a local temperature rise between 2001 and 2017 of 2.2 \u00b0C (Luiselli et al. 2018). While cautioning that it is unclear whether this is a causal relationship, these authors observe that this species' reproductive strategy (which relies on the accumulation of substantial resources to support a single litter) and the reliance on very precise thermoregulation of gravid females make it potentially sensitive to disruption of its thermal ecology. Consistent with this suggestion Brischoux et al. (2016) found that asp vipers experimentally exposed to \"mild wintering conditions\" (approximately 14 \u00b0C) for a month exhibited a significant decrease in body condition, which over an extended period in wild subpopulations has the potential to reduce reproductive output and affect the persistence of subpopulations.Remote imagery suggests that the species' core habitat in Germany has remained essentially unchanged since the 1950s, but that in marginal areas of its range canopy cover has increased in some areas by more than 50%, partly due to increased nutrient loads (Rote-Liste-Gremium Amphibien und Reptilien 2020). This afforestation reduces habitat suitability and connectivity for this species, and as many of these forest areas are protected there are limited opportunities to improve habitat quality by opening the canopy (Rote-Liste-Gremium Amphibien und Reptilien 2020)."

(2017) report that, although this is not an especially desirable species and is not of CITES concern, it can regularly be found in the pet trade and that it may be traded in \"high volumes\". Although this is unlikely to represent a significant pressure to this widespread species as presently understood, it is possible that this trade may include rarer cryptic species (Shaney et al. 2017).

    "threats_description": "This species is threatened by habitat loss through urbanization, conversion to intensive agricultural use (especially the loss of hedgerows and other suitable habitats), coastal and alpine tourism development and the loss of traditional forestry practices, and unsustainable management. Many animals are killed on roads in parts of its range (e.g. Austria). Some populations in Sweden are reported to be suffering from inbreeding depression due to a fragmented distribution (Olsson et al. 1996). There is some predation of animals by cats in urban areas. Open habitats, which this species requires, are being overgrown with vegetation. It is a threatened species in much of the northwest of its range, including the United Kingdom, Scandinavia and northern Germany. It is found in the pet trade, but in numbers that are unlikely to be significant."

Concrete-lined canals are barriers to movement (Brown and Carmony 1999), as are busy highways. Mortality on roads likely is increasing as traffic volume increases on established highways and new roads are built. The most important reason for the decline is habitat loss resulting from development (Campbell and Lamar 2004). It is probably decreasing in southern Sonora due to expanding commercial agriculture."

These threats remain in a limited, although increasingly substantial, portion of the overall range.

    "threats_description": "Summary of primary threats: loss of habitat; habitat fragmentation and isolation of populations, which may become small and nonviable; and direct mortality caused by humans (including illegal snake hunters) and vehicles as habitat is encroached upon by urban/residential development (Brown in Tyning 1992, Brown 1993). 1. HABITAT DESTRUCTION: In states where the snake is legally protected, housing developments near rattlesnake dens are causing the most serious problem. Current laws generally do not mandate habitat protection for endangered or threatened species. In some areas, persons encountering rattlesnakes in new developments have cooperated with protection efforts by calling persons authorized to catch and transport live rattlesnakes. This is an important factor in successfully protecting rattlesnake populations near developments. 2. MARKET HUNTING: Bounty systems have caused a high level of deleterious exploitation and significant reduction or extirpation of populations by a mere handful of people (W.S. Brown unpubl. data). In some areas (e.g., Pennsylvania) bounty hunting led to rattlesnake hunting among the general population and became a major outdoor activity promoted by sports and civic groups. Commercial collecting for the pet trade is an ever-present current threat, despite some decline in recent years. Single individuals have been responsible for removal of several thousand snakes (Stechert 1980). Today, a growing number of persons maintain reptiles in private collections. Timber rattlesnakes, beautiful and easily kept in captivity, are much sought-after. Private collectors are supplied by an often illicit network of collectors, dealers, and buyers. 3. SNAKE HUNTING FOR \"SPORT,\" ORGANIZED SNAKE HUNTS OR \"ROUND-UPS.\" In Pennsylvania, organized snake hunts caused injury and cruelty to captured snakes, displacement from familiar range, removal of gravid females from already-depleted populations, and habitat destruction by snake hunters (Galligan and Dunson 1979, Reinert 1988). Despite regulations, timber rattlesnake populations in Pennsylvania were legally \"harvested\" at a nonsustainable level, leading to the collapse of most den populations (Martin et al. 1990). In response, Pennsylvania regulations were amended such that the open season extends from the second Saturday in June through July 31, with daily bag limit of one snake. These regulations should protect snakes at den sites, prevent stockpiling of snakes, and discourage rattlesnake hunting altogether. 4. SHADING-OVER: In some regions, several investigators believe that \"shading over\" by the growth of large trees on and near a den may be causing conditions that are incompatible with long-term viability for timber rattlesnakes. According to this view, there is a need for an open, lightly wooded or brushy early successional plant association to provide an optimal denning environment. In contrast, Martin (pers. comm. 1990) says: \"Shading over of the den site does not present a problem for snakes at emergence time when the trees are bare or just starting to leaf. The problem is shading over of the rocks that are used as gestating and birthing rookeries.\" Similarly, in Connecticut, G. Hammerson (pers. obs.) found that heavy shading (in summer) did not discourage den use, but he observed reduced use of a gestation/birthing site after it was shaded by growing vegetation. The possible threat of shading-over deserves further study, but it seems likely that shading has temporary, localized effects that are insignificant over the long term on a landscape scale. 5. LOGGING: Commercial tree removal may not necessarily cause long-term harm to a timber rattlesnake population's habitat, but can pose a direct threat to the snakes if conducted during the active season (mainly April-October). 6. ROAD MORTALITY: New Jersey Pine Barrens populations suffer from excessive mortality of gravid females due to vehicular traffic on roads and trails (Zappalorti and Reinert in Tyning 1992). Ill-placed developments and associated new roads and increased traffic can lead to increased mortality of rattlesnakes even in areas several miles from the development."

    "threats_description": "The species is threatened by the intensification of agriculture and the abandonment of traditional meadows (resulting in scrub encroachment - Gal\u00e1n 1999). Although the species occupies a wide range of habitats, it is a specialist of humid, well-vegetated areas with little or no woody vegetation. It is therefore sensitive to the modification or disappearance of these habitats, and the isolation and loss of subpopulations appears to be ongoing on both Iberian plateaux as a result of agricultural intensification (Pollo 2015). In these areas the species seems to be confined to small 'islands' of remnant vegetation within an agricultural matrix (Pollo 2015). In the east of its range a similar pattern is seemingly underway as a result of increasing aridity, which may be exacerbated by climate change (Pollo 2015). Water diversion from wet meadows in the El Padul region seems to have resulted in a local extinction as the species has not been recorded in this area since 2009 and is no longer known to survive in the Sierra Nevada, the southeastern limit of its range (Pollo 2015). Fires have potentially complex consequences for this species, with suggestions both that they facilitate dispersal through opening grassy areas and that they destroy important structural features used as shelter sites (Pollo 2015). Agricultural intensification increases the species' exposure to chemical pollutants, but any impacts of this are unstudied (Pollo 2015).The invasive cat's claw (Hottentot-fig, Carpobrotus edulis) is a threat in coastal grasslands, with skink densities declining from 25.2 in sites with 75-90% coverage of the invasive vine to 4.9 individuals/ha in sites with more than 90% cover (Pollo 2015).This species is persecuted in parts of its range as it is mistakenly believed to be toxic (Pollo 2015)."

In Sweden numbers killed rose from 17,000 in 1990 to 20,000-25,000 in 1996, with smaller numbers shot in Denmark, Germany and Norway.

    "threats_description": "Changes in food availability as a result of commercial fishing is a major threat facing this species. Decreased abundance of Bearded Goby Taenioides jacksoni off the coast of Namibia in 1994 led to population crashes at two major colonies (Mercury and Ichaboe Islands) and extreme food scarcity continues to drive declines (du Toit et al. 2002). Distributional shifts of Cape Rock Lobster Jasus lalandii as a result of lobster fishing caused decreases of larger Bank Cormorant colonies in northern South Africa and increases in the south (Crawford et al. 2008) and continued fishing of this major food source may be contributing to ongoing declines on a national level (Sherley et al. 2016). A further impact of the lobster fishery is incidental bycatch of birds in lobster traps (Cooper 1985).The species suffers from habitat competition (Crawford et al. 1999) and predation (du Toit et al. 2002) by Cape Fur Seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus. In the past, seals at Mercury Island displaced 14% of the global population of Bank Cormorants. The island is now home to 33% of the global population, after seals have been eliminated (du Toit et al. 2002). Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus and Great White Pelicans Pelecanus onocrotalus also depredate cormorant nests (Kemper et al. 2007). The observation of pelicans in locations where they were previously unrecorded suggest that predation pressures may be intensifying (de Ponte Machado 2007).Elevated temperatures and increased frequency and amplitude of storms due to climate change, would have a strong impact on future breeding success of Bank Cormorants. Recent nest failures at Robben Island were related to wave heights and air temperature, with reduced chick survival in years when major storm events coincided with the breeding season (Sherley et al. 2012). 73% of the species is classified at risk of exposure to coastal flooding (Crawford 2015).The species is sensitive to human disturbance when breeding and will abandon nests if approached, leaving the contents vulnerable to predation (Cooper 1987). Between 1978 and 1997, human disturbance resulted in the loss of four colonies, and reductions in the populations at six others (du Toit et al. 2002). Guano mining has contributed to disturbance and habitat loss in the past (Ichaboe Island, 2000) and mining activities are likely to resume in the future (du Toit et al. 2002). Activities related to tourism (sea-kayaking, scuba-diving), organised sport (surf-ski races) and research activities (pellet collection, breeding surveys) pose a threat to the species in parts of its range (du Toit et al. 2002). Commercial development in coastal areas may cause habitat loss through harbour developments, causeways and dredging (du Toit et al. 2002). Although artificial structures, e.g. harbour walls, may provide additional nesting sites, these may represent lower-quality breeding habitat (du Toit et al. 2002, Sherley et al. 2012).Past oil spills (e.g. Apollo Sea, 1994 and Treasure, 2000) severely affected the species. The Treasure oil spill significantly decimated the population (Crawford et al. 2000, du Toit et al. 2002), but numbers subsequently recovered (Sherley et al. 2012). The impacts of previous spills may still be causing reduced reproductive success in affected individuals, and ongoing chronic pollution is known to be impacting other species in the region (African Penguin Spheniscus demersus) (Crawford et al. 2000). Avian Cholera has severely affected other cormorant species and the disease is present on islands with breeding colonies of Bank Cormorants. Yet, only a few deaths related to outbreaks have been recorded and the episodes seem to be predominantly single-species mortality events impacting Cape Cormorants Phalacrocorax capensis (Waller and Underhill 2007)."

    "threats_description": "Chick mortality due to mechanized mowing and consequent increased predation is considered to be the primary threat in Europe (Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006). Intensification of grassland management and the loss of hay meadows and wetlands are considered as the critical threats to its habitats (Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006). Following privatisation, potential changes to land-use and management of agricultural land in the species's core breeding range in Russia and eastern Europe are also possible threats (Sch\u00e4ffer and Mammen 1999). Land abandonment temporarily favours the species, but areas become unsuitable as vegetation becomes too dense and scrub develops. Land abandonment leads to a loss of suitable habitat in 5-10 years (BirdLife International Corncrake Conservation Team 2015). Intensified management of hay meadows, or their conversion to arable, is resulting in widespread habitat loss (Sch\u00e4ffer and Mammen 1999). Across western and central Europe, intensification of grassland management, leading to earlier and rapid mowing of hay and silage, is the main threat (N. Sch\u00e4ffer in litt. 2003). Early mowing and the use of mechanised methods results in the destruction of nests and chicks (Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006). It is a quarry species in Russia, Ukraine and Georgia, but hunting pressure is considered low. Illegal hunting of the species during the Common Quail Coturnix coturnix hunting season has been reported from Bulgaria and Croatia, and 0.5-2.7% of the European population may be susceptible to capture in netting set up for C. coturnix in Egypt each autumn. Introduced mammals, such as domestic cats and the American mink Mustela vison, are reported to be predators of the species's nests, in addition to native species. The species may be disturbed by recreational activities and developments, such as motorways (Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006). Late spring floods can reduce local populations by around 50% (Donaghy 2007)."

Dowsett-Lemaire in litt. 2016). Forest reserves in Benin are also being invaded by farmers, which could threaten populations of the species in this country too (F. Dowsett-Lemaire in litt. 2016). Urban development may also be impacting this species, e.g. in Gambia (C. Barlow in litt. 2018). It is not only threatened by habitat conversion, as in certain areas hunters may kill individuals and use their stuffed heads as disguises while stalking game, although it is treated as a totem species in some areas and so may be relatively protected in such places as a result of this (Kemp 1995, Kemp and Boesman 2017)."

    "threats_description": "The species is listed as Vulnerable in Japan; 19 Japanese colonies have seemingly disappeared, and the populations decreased in twelve of the remaining colonies (14 known + 4 suspected breeding colonies) (Senzaki et al. 2015). The drivers of these apparent local extinctions are unknown, with small colony size being the best predictor of disappearance (Senzaki et al. 2015). The decline in the Shiretoko Peninsula population has been attributed to frequent disturbance by high-speed sightseeing boats, which appear to have displaced breeding sites (Fukuda 2010) and have been demonstrated to alter the daily activity pattern of Spectacled Guillemots (Senzaki et al. 2015). Although the causes of decline remain uncertain in large parts of the species's range, likely threats include food shortages caused by the overexploitation of fish stocks, bycatch (Senzaki et al. 2015), predation by invasive species (fox, Sable, rats), human disturbance and illegal hunting (Nettleship et al. 2018)."

In eastern and southern Africa, hunting is also a problem (Parker 1999), but the main threat appears to be conversion of grassland and light woodland to agriculture (Collar 1996, Turner and Goriup 1989). Collisions with power lines may be a significant threat in parts of the range, particularly South Africa (Hofmeyr 2012). Accidental poisoning by agricultural pesticides may also be a threat to birds foraging on farmland (S. J. Tyler in litt. 2013). Climate change poses a potential threat through shifting habitats and severe droughts (Hofmeyr 2012)."

    "threats_description": "Loss of native forest habitats to urbanisation, agriculture and logging has decreased the overall range in many areas (Scott et al. 1986). The habitat of bryani has been heavily browsed by feral ungulates, and introduced grasses suppress regeneration and potentially increase the risk of fire (Scott et al. 1986). Density is lower in disturbed forest, and ungulates, invasive introduced plants and climate change are thought to be causing declines in habitat quality within the range (VanderWerf 2012, Banko et al. 2013, USFWS 2020). Diseases, such as avian pox and malaria, spread by mosquitoes, are a problem at low and middle elevations, increasing mortality and possibly preventing birds from nesting (E. VanderWerf in litt. 1999, VanderWerf et al. 2006), although elepaios have greater immunity to introduced mosquito-borne diseases than most of the Hawaiian honeycreepers (VanderWerf 2020). Current avian predators include Hawaiian Hawk Buteo solitarius, Hawaiian Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus sandwichensis and Barn Owl Tyto alba (VanderWerf 2020). Introduced mammalian predators including rats, cats Felis catus and mongooses Herpestes auropunctatus are additional threats (Banko et al. 2019, VanderWerf 2020). It has been suggested that the species may also suffer increased mortality associated with infection by chewing lice (Phthiraptera) (Freed et al. 2008). It remains vulnerable to future catastrophic events such as hurricanes (E. VanderWerf in litt. 2012)."

This population appears to be undergoing a long-term decline, but populations in San Francisco bay have increased rapidly over the same period."

    "threats_description": "The main immediate threat is hunting, followed by forest clearance (Bernardo et al. 2011, Cockle and Bodrati 2011). In Misiones (Argentina) and eastern Paraguay, its meat is the most prized among the game birds. Its unwary behaviour makes it an easy target for hunters, leading to its rapid extirpation from areas without effective protection from poaching. In S\u00e3o Paulo, hunting, continued dam construction and conversion to plantation agriculture have brought it to the brink of extinction (Galetti et al. 1997a). At Tabuleiro State Park, Santa Catarina, poaching levels are extremely high (Tomim-Borges et al. 2001). Intervales State Park has been invaded by Mby\u00e1 Indians who hunt and have cleared primary forest formerly used by guans (Olmos et al. 2001). Other localities such as Serra do Mar and Ilhabela state parks suffer from increased poaching because of the dwindling number of park guards (F. Olmos in litt. 2003). In Paraguay, populations are isolated and easily hunted because there are few park rangers. In Argentina, the species is threatened by poachers in all areas not patrolled frequently by park rangers, even in parks (Bodrati and Cockle 2006). In particular, the population in the Yaboti Biosphere Reserve is threatened by poachers from adjacent Brazil and Argentina (Bodrati et al. 2005)."

    "threats_description": "Canyon forest is relatively inaccessible and not as susceptible to logging and conversion to agriculture as surrounding areas (Lammertink et al. 1996; J. M. Lammertink in litt. 1998, 2010); forest loss within the species's range is currently estimated at just ~0.3% across three generations (Tracewski et al. 2016). Some of the species's habitat is cleared for the cultivation of narcotics, although it may be able to tolerate such limited and localised fragmentation (J. M. Lammertink in litt. 2010; C. Villar Rodr\u00edguez et al. in litt. 2012), but it is though likely that the species suffers some persecution from those people who attend such crops (J. M. Lammertink in litt. 2010). It is also hunted by children (J. M. Lammertink in litt. 1998), and it may suffer some reduced reproductive success owing to direct persecution of nesting birds, usually directed towards crows (Corvidae) in some locations (C. Villar Rodr\u00edguez et al. in litt. 2012). The species's food resources have been reduced in some areas by heavy droughts in recent years, forcing birds to forage in new areas, and the population could potentially undergo rapid declines owing to the prolonged droughts that could be associated with projected climate change (C. Villar Rodr\u00edguez et al. in litt. 2012). Breeding groups may be affected by the uncontrolled felling of pine-oak forest, which occurs predominantly in the dry season (and can extend from October to May), and thus coincides with the species's breeding season (C. Villar Rodr\u00edguez et al. in litt. 2012). Suitable habitat is also destroyed and degraded by forest fires, which may affect large areas of forest, owing to altered fire regimes. Road construction has fragmented habitat and is likely to impact the species. Some of the springs used by family groups have been lost to human activities (C. Villar Rodr\u00edguez et al. in litt. 2012)."

    "threats_description": "The primary cause of its decline has been conversion of dry grassland and low-intensity cultivation to intensive arable agriculture, especially where this has included the planting of monocultures or perennial crops, irrigation or afforestation. The fragmentation of traditional habitats, by means of agricultural intensification or infrastructure development, negatively affects habitat availability and quality for the species, as well as male density (Garc\u00eda et al. 2007, E. Garc\u00eda in litt. 2007) as displaying males exhibit a preference for old and same-year fallows which offer shelter and food (Delgado et al. 2010). The use of pesticides could reduce food availability (E. Garc\u00eda in litt. 2007). Harvesting with modern farm machinery, operated at high speed and often during the night, is the key threat to females and nests in Europe and is the cause for the observed male-biased sex structure and low fecundity (I\u00f1igo and Barov 2010, Lapiedra et al. 2011). Farm machinery accounts for 40% of clutch failure in southwest France (Inchausti and Bretagnolle 2005).Conversion to intensive arable agriculture continues to be the primary threat and cause of continuing declines in Europe (E. Garc\u00eda in litt. 2007) and is predicted to cause declines in the eastern population in the near future (Kamp et al. 2011). It also suffers from illegal hunting (Y. Andryuschenko in litt. 1999), although this is a minor threat (V. Bretagnolle in litt. 2007). The collision of birds with overhead powerlines is a locally important cause of mortality (E. Garc\u00eda in litt. 2007), and the possibility of collisions with aircraft has created conflict and resulted in the culling of individuals in France in 2013 - although this was lately stopped (Anon. 2013). The release of farm-reared gamebirds could eventually introduce new pathogens to wild populations of T. tetrax (E. Garc\u00eda in litt. 2007). In Azerbaijan, the main threats are disturbance from intensive land use (mainly heavy grazing), habitat loss to infrastructure development and probably hunting, with individuals shot and sold along roadsides (Gauger 2007, P. Goriup in litt. 2016). Climate change effects could lead to shorter rainy seasons and reduced winter precipitation in Southern Europe, which could have a detrimental effect on habitat quality for the species (Delgado et al. 2009, Delgado and Moreira 2010)."

Sharp declines in Europe in the 1950s-1960s were driven by the use of harmful organochlorine pesticides, which causes direct mortality of adults as well as reduced breeding success. The species is still trapped in its thousands annually in Turkey, where it is used by falconers, but habitat alteration is thought to be the major contemporary threat (del Hoyo et al. 1994). In Madeira and the Canary Islands, forest fires destroy breeding areas and reduce prey availability (Gouveia et al. 2017). It is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012). Ingestion of prey containing lead shot is an additional threat (Fisher et al. 2006)."

    "threats_description": "Widespread accidental poisoning, largely due to strychnine, used by many farmers for predator control, and more recently carbofuran, has contributed significantly to declines (Brown 1986, P. Hall in litt. 2000, Otieno et al. 2010, C. Kendall in litt. 2012). Several Lappet-faced Vultures were found to have died after feeding on the carcass of a poisoned jackal in Namibia (Komen 2009) and two birds were killed as a result of feeding on a poisoned carcass in Kenya (Kendall and Virani 2012). A mass poisoning event involving at least 15 Lappet-faced Vultures occurred in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe in 2012 (Groom et al. 2012), while another in Botswana in 2019 resulted in the death of 14 Lappet-faced Vultures (BirdGuides 2019). The upper beaks of eight of these birds were removed suggesting that they may be traded for traditional medicine. It is also often mistakenly persecuted as a livestock predator (Brown 1986): one major deliberate poisoning incident killed 86 individuals in Namibia (Simmons 1995). Other major threats to the species include nest predation by humans, reduced food availability (including the replacement of the traditional \"Dabokka\" movement of camels with cargo tracks [H. Ibrahim in litt. 2016]) and electrocution (Shimelis et al. 2005). Increasing use of agricultural pesticides may also be a problem for the species (Mundy et al. 1992), including those breeding at Tayma, Saudi Arabia (Shimelis et al. 2005). Nest disturbance, to which it is extremely sensitive (Steyn 1982), may be growing with an increase in forest settlements in Ethiopia (A. Shimelis in litt. 2007) and the increasing recreational use of off-road vehicles (Mundy et al. 1992). In Saudi Arabia, suitable nesting trees may be subject to the most intense human disturbance as shepherds also use the same large trees for shelter for themselves and their livestock (Shobrak 2011). Breeding birds at Tayma could face disturbance from motorised vehicles in the desert (Shimelis et al. 2005). Nest trees are also susceptible to fire and are often pushed over by elephants (Murn and Botha in prep.), although tree availability is not thought to be a limiting factor for the species (Kendall et al. 2017).The population collapse in West Africa may be a result of higher nest disturbance, local extinctions of wild ungulates through habitat modification and over-hunting, intensified cattle farming in which sick or dying animals are rarely abandoned, and an increase in accidental poisoning (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004, Thiollay 2006), although the latter threat, in particular, requires further study (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). National vaccination campaigns in West Africa have reduced illness in domestic livestock, and sick animals can now be sold off, rather than abandoned, due to the proliferation of markets and abattoirs (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). The species may be hunted for medicine and cultural reasons in West Africa, and some ethnic groups in the sub-region hunt vultures for food, though the impact on this species is unknown (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). It is also thought to be used for traditional medicine in South Africa, with all vultures having the potential for traditional medicine use in southern Africa (McKean et al. 2013, W. Goodwin in litt. 2016) and has been recorded in trade in West and Central African markets (Buij et al. 2016). With 858-1,284 individuals reported to have been traded over a six year period in West Africa, numbers traded represent a potentially significant proportion of the regional population.In central Mozambique, the population has declined due to a scarcity of game and livestock following the armed conflict of the 1970s and 1980s, and the surviving population continues to be threatened by the over-exploitation of game by poachers (Parker 2005). There are incidences of deliberate poisoning by poachers, due to the belief that the arriving vultures will give away the locations of poached animals (Hancock 2009, Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada et al. 2015). In Ethiopia, the principal threat to the species is habitat loss on the lowland plains (A. Shimelis in litt. 2007, 2012). Potential introduction of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, which is fatal to Gyps spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses may represent a potential future threat to the species."

    "threats_description": "Reductions in populations of medium-sized mammals and wild ungulates, as well as habitat conversion through agricultural intensification and development throughout its range best explain the current decline (Mundy et al. 1992, P. Hall in litt. 1999, R. Davies in litt. 2006). Additional threats include indirect poisoning (R. Davies in litt. 2006) at baits set to kill jackals in small-stock farming areas, and in East Africa at poisoned baits set for larger mammalian carnivores such as lions and hyenas (C. Kendall in litt. 2012), and, particularly in East Africa, secondary poisoning from carbofuran and other poisons (Otieno et al. 2010). Deliberate poisoning to prevent vultures drawing attention to poaching activities has also been documented (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada et al. 2016). 17 White-headed Vultures were killed in a mass poisoning event in Botswana in 2019 (BirdGuides 2019). Exploitation for the international trade in raptors (N. Baker in litt. 2006) also poses a threat. In 2005, 30 individuals of this species were confiscated by the Italian authorities (F. Genero in litt. 2005). The species is recorded in trade in West and Central Africa (Buij et al. 2015). In South Africa, this species is captured for use in traditional medicines (R. E. Simmons and C. J. Brown in litt. 2006) and in Zambia White-headed Vultures have apparently been intentionally killed for use in witchcraft (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012). Breeding birds may readily desert nests in areas of high human disturbance (R. E. Simmons and C. J. Brown in litt. 2006). The species is highly sensitive to land-use and is highly concentrated in protected areas (Hancock 2008). Potential introduction of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, which is fatal to Gyps spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses may represent a potential future threat to the species, although livestock have not been recorded as a potential food source for this species (C. Murn in litt. 2016)."

Kori Bustards were the second most commonly recovered bird after Ludwig\u2019s Bustard on extensive mortality surveys in the Karoo, with720 (95% CI 190-1,260) estimated to be killed annually on transmission lines in the Nama Karoo alone (Shaw 2013). Declines in Tanzania can probably be attributed to trade in the species during the 1990s and 2000s (N. Cordeiro in litt. 2013). There is also anecdotal information from South Africa indicating that the species is used in the muti (traditional medicine) trade, hunted for bush meat, and illegally kept as pets (R. Coetzee in litt. 2013). The causes of population declines and range losses in many parts of the distribution are unknown, but have been hypothesised to include persecution, rangeland degradation and shrub encroachment (Senyatso et al. 2012). In Botswana, unregulated hunting appears to be a genuine threat while cattle-induced bush encroachment is not (Senyatso 2011)."

    "threats_description": "The species is assumed to be declining throughout much of its range in the face of a multitude of threats (Boshoff and Anderson 2007). Sixteen known or suspected mortality factors were identified and ranked at an expert workshop with a decrease in the amount of carrion (particularly during chick-rearing), inadvertent poisoning, electrocution on pylons or collision with cables, loss of foraging habitat and unsustainable harvesting for traditional uses considered the most important factors (Mundy et al. 1992, Barnes 2000, Benson 2000, Borello and Borello 2002, Boshoff and Anderson 2007). The primary threats are currently thought to be contamination of their food supply and possibly a shortage in food supply, negative interactions with human infrastructure and hunting for use in the traditional health industry (Allan 2015). Further threats include disturbance at colonies, bush encroachment and drowning (Anderson 1999, Borello and Borello 2002, Bamford et al. 2007). In southern Africa, vultures are caught and consumed for perceived medicinal and psychological benefits (McKean and Botha 2007, Anon. 2008). It is estimated that 160 vultures are sold and that there are 59,000 vulture-part consumption events in eastern South Africa each year, involving an estimated 1,250 hunters, traders and healers. At current harvest levels, the populations of this species in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho could become locally extinct within 44-53 years. Should the populations of White-backed Vultures G. africanus become depleted first, the resultant increase in hunting pressure on G. coprotheres could cause a population collapse within the subsequent 12 years (McKean and Botha 2007, Anon. 2008). Extrapolation from a limited study of traditional healers in Maseru, Lesotho, suggests that, conservatively, nearly 7% of the breeding population in that country would be lost annually for such use (Beilis and Esterhuizen 2005). A study in South Africa found that should current rates of exploitation for market trade continue then the populations in Lesotho, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape could be exhausted within 54 years (McKean et al. 2013).The species suffers mortality from the ingestion of poison left for pests (not vultures) (Diekmann and Strachan 2006) and potentially diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, and which is fatal to Gyps spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses (BirdLife International news www.birdlife.org/news 2008). In 2007, diclofenac, was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International news www.birdlife.org/news 2008). In addition, it was reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden in litt. 2007) and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International news www.birdlife.org/news 2008). A single poisoning incident can kill 50-500 birds, making the species susceptible to sudden local declines (M. Diekmann in litt. 2006). The collapse of a key colony in eastern Botswana has been attributed to human disturbance, especially insensitive tourism (Borello and Borello 2002). The ongoing urbanisation around Hartbeespoort Dam and the Magaliesberg Mountains, South Africa, has limited the extent of natural areas for foraging by vultures, perhaps resulting in their reliance on supplementary food at vulture \"restaurants\" (Wolter et al. 2007). If such restaurants were closed, vultures might be exposed to unsafe carcasses (Wolter et al. 2007).Poor grassland management in some areas has promoted bush encroachment, making finding carcasses more difficult for vultures (Schultz 2007, Bamford et al. 2009). There are records of at least 120 individuals (21 incidents) of this species drowning in small farm reservoirs in southern Africa between the early 1970s and late 1990s (Anderson et al. 1999), although modifications to many reservoirs have now been made (Boshoff et al. 2009). Raptors are thought to drown after attempting to bathe or drink, with mass vulture drownings probably due to the triggering of group behaviour by the actions of one bird (Anderson et al. 1999). In Magaliesberg a large number of fatalities have been associated with powerline collisions and electrocutions, and this is one of the main factors causing the ongoing decline of the species in South Africa (K. Wolter in litt. 2007). It is estimated that a minimum of 80 vultures are killed annually by collision with powerlines in Eastern Cape Province (Boshoff et al. 2011). Also, due to an increase in incident reporting in South Africa, it is becoming evident that this threat to the species is severe. The strategic partnership between The Endangered Wildlife Trust and South Africa\u2019s energy supplier, Eskom, has been recording wildlife-energy infrastructure interactions since October 1996. This database has 403 incidents involving the Cape Vulture; totaling 1,022 individuals, of which 866 individuals have died as a result of electrocution incidents on power lines, while 156 have been killed colliding with overhead cables (S. Page-Nicholson and C. Hoogstad in litt. 2016).A controversial wind farm development in Maluti-Drakensberg, Lesotho, an important site for Cape Vulture was given approval in 2014 (Anon. 2014), and even relatively small-scale wind energy developments in the Lesotho Highlands pose a threat to the species (Rushworth and Kr\u00fcger 2014), especially as, even after rehabilitation, injured (or poisoned) individuals have increased mortality compared to individuals of a similar age (Monadjem et al. 2014). It is reported that a lack of adult females in the relict Namibian population may have led to four males breeding with G. africanus, although this is not thought to be a problem across southern Africa (Diekmann and Strachan 2006). Patterns in the contraction of the species's range since the 1950s imply that climate change could be an underlying factor driving its decline through changes in habitats and decreases in prey populations, though further research is required to confirm a link (Simmons and Jenkins 2007)."

    "threats_description": "The species has conceivably lost 50% of its preferred breeding habitat over the last century (Curtis et al. 2004), and present rates of loss in the Overberg may be over 1% per annum (R.E. Simmons in litt. 2007). Habitat is primarily lost to agriculture, and this is compounded by the uncontrolled burning of fynbos and grassland, which renders these habitats unsuitable for breeding for about five years (R.E. Simmons, O. Curtis and A. Jenkins in litt. 2004). Alien vegetation and urbanisation are also cited as causes of habitat loss (Curtis et al. 2004). In south-western South Africa, it is thought that breeding birds have been displaced from prime lowland habitats (renosterveld and fynbos) by the spread of cereal agriculture, with breeding pairs presently occupying only coastal areas, with high productivity, and montane habitats, where breeding success is low and levels of nest predation are high (Curtis et al. 2004). It is particularly vulnerable to nest predation because it nests on the ground (see Lee and Simmons 2014). Rodent populations in areas of wheat cultivation may be as low as 33% of those found in renosterveld vegetation (R.E. Simmons in litt. 2004), and remnant patches of renosterveld, which continue to be degraded (R.E. Simmons, O. Curtis and A. Jenkins in litt. 2004), hold lower numbers of rodents than coastal strandveld vegetation (R.E. Simmons in litt. 2004). Low hatching rates, possibly as a result of high pesticide residues, is an increasing threat now that many remaining breeding habitats are surrounded by agricultural areas (R.E. Simmons, O. Curtis and A. Jenkins in litt. 2004). The ingestion of herbicides and pesticides may account for the death of some adults in South Africa (Simmons 2005). Persistent organocholorines, which were found in blood samples from South African birds, may cause physical stress and reduced immunity at higher blood concentrations (Garcia-Heras et al. 2017b). Road deaths adjacent to west coast breeding grounds also numbered six birds over one breeding season in 2007 (R.E. Simmons in litt. 2007). Drainage, impoundment and inappropriate management of vleis, marshes or streams near breeding grounds could prove detrimental. Climate change in South Africa is predicted to cause a decrease in overall winter rainfall in the core breeding areas, which is likely to lead to a reduction in mouse populations and disruption to breeding (R.E. Simmons in litt. 2007). The same threats may apply to the species in Namibia, and the favoured habitats of the migrant population may be overgrazed, particularly in southern Namibia (Simmons 2005). Overgrazing in southern Namibia is attributed mainly to resident pastoralists and 'emergency grazing' by farmers from elsewhere, which is offered during years of good rainfall (R.E. Simmons in litt. 2007). Assessments carried out between 2016-2019 found wind farms to be a major threat to Black Harriers, with a mortality rate of 1.5 birds per year at some farms (R.E Simmons, 2019, pers. comm.,). Initial results from a PVA underway by Cervantes et al., (in prep) suggest that if an average of three birds were killed per year by wind farms in South Africa the population would collapse in about 100 years, while if five birds were killed per year by wind farms in South Africa the population would collapse in less than 75 years."

    "threats_description": "Human recreation (e.g. watersports) poses a threat to this species through disturbance (Kear 2005a). In South Africa, the Aardvark is considered threatened so the species's reliance on this mammal for nest sites is a concern (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a). The species may also come under threat through range shifts or contractions as a result of climate change (van Jaarsveld et al. 2005) and West African populations have already come under threat by the desiccation of the Sahel zone (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is susceptible to avian botulism, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974). At the Klingnau Dam in northen Switzerland the species has been known to hybridise with Ruddy Shelduck Tadorna ferruginea from escaped captive populations, which could pose a threat to the integrity of both species (Owen et al. 2006). Utilisation The species is hunted mainly for sport (Little et al. 1995, Hockey et al. 2005, Kear 2005a), but there is no evidence that this currently poses a threat."

    "threats_description": "In recent times, the number of available chimneys has decreased as a result of the demolition of old buildings, the capping of old chimneys and through chimney sweeps removing nests from chimneys (despite the species being protected by federal law) (COSEWIC 2007, R. Windingstad in litt. 2010, Steeves et al. 2014). Even though a scarcity of chimneys may not be limiting the numbers of Chimney Swifts yet (Wake 2016, Stewart et al. 2017), the rate of habitat loss is increasing and possibly developing into a severe threat (C. Artuso in litt. 2018). Logging of old-growth forest may also reduce the number of breeding sites for the species (Steeves et al. 2014). It is projected that very few suitable sites will remain within the next thirty years (COSEWIC 2007). The number of breeding sites in Quebec is limited, and it is estimated that only 60% of breeding-age adults actually reproduce; a trend which is thought to be replicated across Canada (COSEWIC 2007). Additionally, the use of DDT in the 1950s to control insect populations may have caused a shift in Chimney Swift diet, although the long term impact on the species is uncertain (Nocera et al. 2012, Steeves et al. 2014). Hurricanes during the migration period and harsh weather conditions during the breeding season have caused a considerable number of deaths (COSEWIC 2007, Dionne et al. 2008). In its South American wintering area, the species is threatened by intensive logging operations and by fires (COSEWIC 2007). Overall, the key threat is thought to be the ongoing loss of potential nesting sites (although this may not be the case for all populations; Fitzgerald et al. 2014)."

    "threats_description": "This species is harvested for food in Micronesia and Tokelau (Szabo 2013), although this is not thought to cause significant declines. House Rats Rattus rattus and cats Felis catus are thought to have been responsible for the extirpation of Black Noddy from Raoul Island (Szabo 2013) and remain a problem in the main Hawai\u2019ian islands (Mitchell et al. 2005) and likely much of the rest of the Noddy\u2019s range. Invasive herbivores pose a threat through denudation of vegetation, with goats likely responsible for its extirpation on Malden Island (Gochfeld et al. 2018). The denudation of Phillip Island by goats, before they died out in the early 1900s, and subsequent prevention of regrowth by rabbits, before their eradication in 1988, is likely to have contributed to their historical decline on this island (Priddel et al. 2010). Increased sea-surface temperatures (SST) have been demonstrated to reduce the provisioning rate at studied colonies along the Great Barrier Reef, and above a particular temperature threshold, reproductive success has been recorded to be zero (Chambers et al. 2011). At present this impact appears restricted to a minority of the breeding population, and colonies have become established at new locations which may be related to adaption to climate impacts."

    "threats_description": "Climate change is an important potential candidate for explaining recent declines. Large-scale environmental changes, particularly those related to sea temperatures could be contributing to habitat loss, indirect ecosystem effects, direct species mortality and reduced reproductive success, but the nature and level of impacts remain unclear as there may be divergent responses in different populations; climate was found to be have potentially positive effects in the short to medium term for the population studied at Bird Island, South Georgia, whereas changes to predation dynamics appear to be an important factor driving declines (Horswill et al. 2014, 2016).Historical and continuing prey competition with fur seals Arctocephalus spp. at South Georgia is considered to have substantially contributed to declines noted over the past several decades, with the fur seal population increasing from an estimated 30,000 to c. 3 million in the past few decades (Barlow et al. 2002, Trathan et al. 2012). Recovery of fur seals at the Prince Edward Islands could increase competition for prey as well as causing increased predation pressure on penguins (Dyer and Crawford 2015). Increasing seal populations could also block access to breeding sites thereby inhibiting colony growth, as demonstrated on Bouvet Island (Isaksen et al. 1997). In the South Georgia population, predation appears to be of secondary concern with relatively few fur seals predating penguins and local penguin declines starting well in advance of increases in seal predation (J. Croxall in litt. 2017). Giant Petrels Macronectes spp. contribute to predation pressures on immature penguins, targeting them in the vulnerable fledgling phase (Horswill et al. 2014, 2016). Commercial fisheries could represent a potential threat through incidental capture and resource competition. Long-line fisheries at winter feeding grounds have inflicted limited bycatch mortality on Macaroni Penguins (Dyer and Crawford 2015) and harvesting of Antarctic krill could reduce food availability if management does not adequately take into account the dietary needs of the species. Invasive mammals including cats, mice and rabbits are present on a number of sub-Antarctic islands but their current impact on the species is thought to be negligible (Crossin et al. 2013). Breeding colonies on Marion Island have previously shown declines following outbreaks of avian cholera and other unknown diseases (Cooper et al. 2009). Human impacts potentially also include disturbance from tourists, scientists, construction of new science facilities and fisheries. Oil spills may also be important at local scales. Protection of habitat on land and at sea remains important, with the designation of appropriate protection for transit, foraging and rafting areas at sea."

    "threats_description": "Its widespread historical decline was probably caused by a combination of intensive agriculture, invasion of pastoral land by woody weeds, hunting, changes to fire regimes and predation by the Red Fox Vulpes vulpes (Harrington et al. 1984, Marchant and Higgins 1993, J. Woinarski in litt. 2007). It readily deserts nests in response to disturbance by humans, sheep or cattle (Marchant and Higgins 1993). Pesticides, either directly or indirectly ingested, are also held responsible for local extinctions (Ziembicki and Woinarski 2007). The area where it has declined corresponds with the distribution of foxes in Australia, a distribution that may be slowly expanding northwards. Traditional and illegal hunting by people is also considerable and may be contributing to the perceived decline in northern and central Australia (Garnett and Crowley 2000). Across northern Australia it may be less common in areas invaded by woody weeds. Local increases in abundance have occurred in parts of northern Australia in response to recent clearing (Garnett and Crowley 2000) and subsequent horticultural development, but this effect may dissipate as agriculture intensifies (J. Woinarski in litt. 2007)."

An analysis of forest loss from 2000 to 2012 estimated forest loss within the species's range at 43.8% across three generation lengths (Tracewski et al. 2016). Additionally, the species is known to be impacted by hunting. It is caught for food, trade and the use of body parts (namely its casque and tail feathers) in ceremonial dress (Kinnaird and O'Brien 2007, Kemp and Boesman 2018), especially on Borneo by the Iban and Orang Ulu communities (L. Sir in litt. 2020). The species may also be taken as \u2018bycatch\u2019 by hunters targeting Helmeted Hornbill Rhinoplax vigil (R. Wirth in litt. 2017). The rate of decline due to hunting is uncertain, however hunting for feathers and casques is likely to increase for commercial and cultural purposes via online platforms in Kalimantan, Indonesia (Y. Hadiprakarsa, pers. comm.)"

    "threats_description": "The species's habit of nesting in densely packed colonies leaves it at considerable risk of predation by invasive predators including stoats, feral cats, hedgehogs and rats (Mills 2013). It is also vulnerable to predation by native species, with an entire colony at Kaikoura abandoned following chick predation by a single Northern Giant Petrel (Mills et al. 2013). There is also potentially a risk from the spread of the weed Sea Spurge Euphorbia paralias; however, this does not seem to be significant at present."

    "threats_description": "Interactions with fisheries may pose a threat to the species through incidental capture in fishing nets and resource competition (Ellis et al. 1998). The species appears to be actively feeding on discards from trawling fleets, making it susceptible to bycatch, which potentially could be causing slow but significant declines for the minority of the population whose foraging range overlaps with fisheries (Crawford et al. 2017). Future intensification of resource competition could lead to more rapid declines for exposed populations. Increasing oil exploration around the Falkland Islands is a growing concern for the species (Lynch 2013) and pollution from oil spills represents a threat on local scales. Harmful algal blooms were attributed as the cause of the paralytic shellfish poisoning incident that resulted in a major Gentoo Penguin mortality event in 2002, from which the population took several years to recover (Pistorius et al. 2010). Hence, algal blooms appear to have the potential to cause population fluctuations in parts of the global population. Recent diseases leading to massive mortality at some colonies have also been observed recently at Crozet and Kerguelen, sometime in remote colonies (C.A Bost in litt. 2019). The origin of such diseases is still under study.Disturbance from tourism has been shown to cause decreased breeding productivity (Trathan et al. 2008, Lynch et al. 2009, Dunn et al. 2019) and the associated marine traffic is likely to impact penguins foraging in inshore waters (Lynch et al. 2010); increased understanding about the potential impacts of tourism will therefore be important. However, sites visited by tourists collectively account for less than 5% of total population in the Falklands (Malvinas), South Georgia and British Antarctic Territories (J. Croxall in litt. 2017).Historically, egg collection was widespread on the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) (Clausen and P\u00fctz 2002), and some legal egg collection still continues (Otley et al. 2004).Ingestion of plastic particles (Bessa et al. 2019) highlight the need for further assessment of the levels of microplastics in this and other penguin species in the Southern Ocean; specifically studies on temporal trends and potential effects on penguins and other organisms in the Antarctic marine food web are needed.Gentoo Penguins and the Crozet subspecies of Imperial Shag Phalacrocorax atriceps melanogenis have considerable overlap in their diets, and their congruent declines on Marion Island were likely driven by food availability linked to benthic production around the island. Hence, the species is considered to be vulnerable to environmental changes influencing local oceanography, such as frontal positions that effect food availability at the Prince Edward Islands and elsewhere (Crawford et al. 2014). Protection of habitat on land and at sea remains important, with the designation of appropriate protection for transit, foraging and rafting areas at sea."

    "threats_description": "The threats to this species are largely unknown and untested. The decline in Japan has by some been attributed to losses in Australia as a result of extreme drought and large\u2010scale fire in alpine grasslands in 2019 and 2010 (Ura and Tajiri 2020). The current threats in Australia are drainage, water diversion and urban development, although the species readily occupies artificial and ephemeral swamps (Higgins and Davies 1996). Over the longer\u2010term, drought caused by climate change is likely to be a strong driving factor. Grasslands on Cape York Peninsula used during transit north (Garnett and Shephard 1997) are slowly being occluded by trees (Crowley and Garnett 1998), but not at a rate that currently threatens the species. Until the mid\u20101980s, hunting in the freshwater swamps in southern Australia was responsible for the deaths of up to 10,000 Latham's Snipe each year (Naarding 1986). In Japan, there have been declines where agricultural grasslands have been abandoned and colonised by trees or replaced by urban development and agricultural intensification (Ura et al. 2017). In Russia, snipes are likely to be subject to hunting, but the scale is thought to be limited (Gallo\u2010Cajiao et al. 2020, B. Oleg in litt. 2022, P. Ktitorov in litt. 2022)."

    "threats_description": "Key threats are habitat loss, degradation and disturbance. Across the Indian subcontinent, and probably most of its range, wetlands have been drained or converted for agriculture and human settlements. The felling of large trees near wetlands has reduced the availability of nest and roost sites. The spread of water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes is a problem in India, as is the siltation of lakes due to catchment deforestation. Pollution of wetlands with pesticides and industrial effluents reduces breeding success. Habitat loss and degradation are compounded by disturbance of wetlands. Reductions in the prey base, primarily through hunting and over-fishing, are further consequences of increasing human pressure. In Myanmar, the development of oil and gas fields is a threat and, in China, hunting is a localised problem (Orta et al. 2020). In Mongolia, during surveys in summer 2009, it was noted that two recently completed hydroelectric dams were severely disrupting water levels in the affected drainage basins and could potentially affect all sites where the species occurs in the Great Lake Basin (Gilbert and Gombobataar 2009). Over-fishing was also noted at several sites and low rainfall was leading to falling water levels in some areas (Gilbert and Gombobataar 2009). Loss of mature trees following two major cyclones may have affected breeding sites in Odisha, India (M. Bhujabal in litt. 2017)."

    "threats_description": "Many birds are shot on migration, notably in Italy, Malta and Lebanon (del Hoyo et al. 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and particularly in Georgia. In Georgia the species is hunted for sort, consumption and medicinal properties which means it is the most commonly hunted raptor on migration (van Maanen et al. 2001). Recently it was estimated that hunting in Georgia effects 1.1% of the migratory population which is annually recorded in passage in the country (Hoekstra et al. 2020), suggesting low, but significant declines. Direct mortality from shooting on migration was recorded as the highest cause of mortality (De Pascalis et al. 2020), and whilst European Honey-buzzards suffer from collision-mortality from vehicles and electrocution (Fransson et al. 2019), these appear more minor compared to shooting. Wind farm projects constructed on main migration routes could be a significant threat, as the species is highly vulnerable to Collison with turbines (Hilgerloh et al. 2011; STRIX 2012).While declines in northern Europe are thought to have resulted from deforestation and forest conversion in the past, European Honey-Buzzards appear relatively robust to changes in breeding habitat, suggesting mortality on migration or during non-breeding grounds is of greater threat (Bj\u00f6rklund et al. 2015). Although pesticide use has not had significant impacts in Europe (due to the species living in woodland and feeding on wasps), it may do in Africa, where there are fewer restrictions on usage and the species may be poisoned through its locust prey (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).Relatively less information is available for threats which occur during the African non-breeding period. However, within Africa birds appear reliant on large tracts of continuous forest suggesting widespread deforestation and fragmentation is likely negatively impacting honey-buzzards in Africa (Howes et al. 2020)."

    "threats_description": "Following the large increase in numbers, possibly due to agricultural development, the Common Grackle is now one of the most abundant species in North America (Peer and Bollinger 1997). They occur in large flocks and dense roosting aggregations in parks and agricultural areas, where they damage grains, seeds and fruits and are now regarded as an economically significant pest species (Peer and Bollinger 1997). Moreover, its roosting sites can hold the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, which can cause the lethal human respiratory disease histoplasmosis (Peer and Bollinger 1997). Consequently, the species has been subject to extensive deterring and population control measures, which may include chemical repellents (Methiocarb) or lethal surfactants (PA-14) (Peer and Bollinger 1997)."

    "threats_description": "This species is suspected to have declined by 40-60% over the past three generations (31 years: 1992-2023). The main, if not entire, cause of such rapid declines is the widespread and large-scale clearance of the lowland forests upon which this depends (Berdie 2008) to make space for plantations, chiefly oil-palm and, to a lesser extent, rubber and timber. These losses have disproportionately impacted peatswamp forests (Miettinen et al. 2011), which host the largest populations of this species. While this species has been observed in degraded habitats, there is no evidence they can persist in plantations, and breeding has been observed only in primary forest (see Discussion in Martin et al. [2022]). Forest fires are also a risk, especially in dry El Ni\u00f1o years (Harrison et al. 2016). There is little evidence this species is hunted; incidental (mostly subsistence) hunting almost certainly occurs, but there is no evidence this is a factor in its decline."

    "threats_description": "By mid-2000, Gyps vultures were being found dead and dying in Pakistan and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported (Prakash et al. 2003, 2007, Gilbert et al. 2006). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality, with renal failure resulting in visceral gout found in the vast majority of examined vultures (Oaks et al. 2004a, Shultz et al. 2004, Swan et al. 2006b, Gilbert et al. 2006). Vultures are exposed to diclofenac and other NSAIDs through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that have been treated with the drugs prior to death and left for scavengers to consume (as is tradition in Hindu cultures). Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs that then cause renal failure and death. Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in the species just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues (Green et al. 2004), and sampling livestock carcasses in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart et al. 2009). Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations (Paudel 2008), potentially leading to a slower uptake of meloxicam, an alternative veterinary drug that is of low toxicity to vultures and which has been promoted as a safe alternative to diclofenac in the region (Swan et al. 2006a, Swarup et al. 2007). Recent bans of diclofenac in the region still have not eradicated its use in veterinary treatments, as it is still found in the carcasses of livestock and vultures (Cuthbert et al. 2014, 2015). This may be because the drug continues to be produced for human consumption, which is then sold on for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert et al. 2011, T. Galligan in litt. 2016); though this is not so much of a problem in Nepal and Pakistan (SAVE 2015). A second veterinary drug in use in India, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that they are present in sufficient concentrations to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo et al. 2010). Additionally, aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac, which is converted to diclofenac in cattle (Galligan et al. 2016), and is therefore as toxic to vultures as diclofenac itself. Wild vultures have also been found dead in India with visceral gout and residues of the veterinary NSAID nimesulide in their tissues (Cuthbert et al. 2016; Nambirajan et al. in prep. 2021). This combination has only been found previously for gout and diclofenac, and therefore provides a strong indication that nimesulide is also toxic to vultures (C. Bowden in litt. 2016). The availability of other NSAIDs, including ketoprofen and nimesulide, is increasing (Cuthbert et al. 2011b, Khan 2013, C. Bowden in litt. 2016). Flunixin is another NSAID that has been associated with visceral gout in vultures (Zorrilla et al. 2015), though it is not commonly in use in South Asia yet (T. Galligan in litt. 2016). Other possible contributory factors are changes in human consumption and processing of dead livestock (which have occurred in response to the collapse in vulture numbers), unintentional poisoning from consumption of poisoned baits intended for feral dogs or wild carnivores, electrocution or collision with energy infrastructure, disturbance from rock climbers at cliff nesting sites (Botha et al. 2017), drought (Hall et al. 2012) and mining activity (Chhangani 2004)."

In Burundi it is threatened by disturbance, exploitation at colonies (Hockey et al. 2005), destruction of habitats and environmental pollution (Ntahuga 2000). The species was formerly abundant in southern Turkey but became extinct there when its breeding grounds at Lake Amik were lost (Kirwan et al. 2010) due to drainage and land reclamation (Smith et al. 2014). In Iraq the species is likely to have suffered during the Gulf War of 1991 (del Hoyo et al. 2016)."

    "threats_description": "The species suffers from direct persecution (shooting and trapping) by farmers, indirect poisoning (these two threats by far the most important causes of losses), drowning in sheer-walled reservoirs, electrocution on power lines, habitat alteration and degradation (Global Raptor Information Network 2009), and nest disturbance (JM Thiollay pers. comm. 2020). Poisoning is largely carried out by a few large-scale commercial farmers, but is also a problem in tribal small-stock farming communities. Incidences of targeted poisoning in retaliation for the predation of domestic livestock have been recorded in Kenya (R. Hatfield in litt. 2020). Deforestation may be having less of an impact on this species than on other large eagles, as this species can utilise man-made structures for nesting. In west Africa, it is also threatened by a decline in suitable prey through over-hunting (JM Thiollay pers. comm. 2020). Large mammal populations in west Africa are highly threatened, and the threats are likely to increase in the future as human populations continue to grow. (H. Rainey in litt. 2013). Reduction in natural prey may lead to an increase in predation on domestic animals, which may in turn lead to increased persecution by farmers. In some areas, birds may be taken for use in traditional medicine, and parts have been found in muthi markets in Johannesburg (R. Coetzee in litt. 2013). The majority of protected areas in Kenya are too small to hold a single pair (S. Thomsett in litt. 2013), and the size of territory means that birds nesting in protected areas will generally forage far outside them, making them more vulnerable to persecution. In South Africa, the highest declines were observed in areas with the greatest increase in temperature and areas with high densities of power lines, probably due to collisions and electrocutions. In Kruger National Park, higher densities of elephants were related to larger declines in Martial Eagles, probably as a result of a reduction in nesting sites or changes in habitat quality (Cloete 2013, R. van Eeden in litt. 2013). Between 2013-2020, breeding success rate in the Kruger National Park has been poor (M. Murgatroyd in litt. 2020). The species can use power pylons as nesting sites, which can lead to power outages, and so create human-wildlife conflict (Jenkins et al. 2013)."

    "threats_description": "The species is threatened by the loss and degradation of wetland breeding areas through drought-related changes in land-use (such as for cultivation [T. Fakarayi in litt. 2016]), drainage and overgrazing (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (e.g. uncontrolled cattle grazing [Kampamba and Pope 1996]), as well as through the heavy use of agricultural pesticides (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996), declines in fallowing practices, high sedimentation rates (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (due to deforestation [Meine and Archibald 1996]), uncontrolled grass and deep litter fires in the breeding season (Kampamba and Pope 1996), dam construction (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996) (for hydroelectric power generation [Kampamba and Pope 1996]) and groundwater extraction, leading to changes in hydrological regimes (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996) (e.g. unseasonal flooding [Kampamba and Pope 1996]). The species is also threatened by live-trapping (for trade), egg-collecting and hunting (Meine and Archibald 1996, Kampamba and Pope 1996, Olupot et al. 2009), and by indirect disturbance from the hunting of large mammals or ducks in wetlands and the activities of fisheries (Kampamba and Pope 1996). Preliminary studies of information from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Namibia have shown that that the illegal captive trade is particularly significant from Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda (Morrison 2008, 2009), with the demand being domestic (South Africa and Rwanda) and from the Middle/Far East, and specifically relating to the pet trade, captive facilities and informal zoos (K. Morrison in litt. 2011). Due to human population pressure, the cranes are increasingly living in closer proximity to people, exposing them to disturbance and making them more vulnerable to hunting (W. Olupot in litt. 2011, O. Mabhachi in litt. 2012). It is also persecuted in some areas (e.g. southern Africa) due to its use of agricultural land for foraging, as it will destroy maize crops at their early stage of germination (Hockey et al. 2005, T. Fakarayi in litt. 2016). Research has found that large numbers of Grey Crowned-cranes are killed annually by poisoning in Kenya, mainly as retaliation or to prevent of crop damage (Morrison 2008, 2009). In South Africa in particular, an increase of coal mining is threatening much of the grassland/wetland habitat where the species breeds (K. Morrison in litt. 2011). Mortality of birds due to electrocution and collision with overhead power lines is a serious threat in Uganda, South Africa and Tanzania and is likely to increase significantly in the future, across its entire range (K. Morrison in litt. 2011, J. Harris in litt. 2012)."

    "threats_description": "Globally there are no major threats to this species. However in its West African range, habitat degradation owing to wood harvesting, burning and overgrazing, as well as insecticides used to control locust outbreaks are potential threats (Thiollay 2006). Consumptive use also poses a potential threat in some parts of its range. In Thailand, illegal trade of Accipiter badius has been recorded since 1968 (Siriwat and Nijman 2020) and continues to take place, predominantly via social media (Panter and White 2020, Siriwat and Nijman 2020). There is also evidence of trade of the species in India (TRAFFIC 2016a, Ahmed 1997), Vietnam (TRAFFIC 2016b), and West and Central Africa (Buij et al. 2016). The species has a long standing tradition of use in falconry in India and Pakistan (Ali and Arshad 2010, Ahmed 1997), while trade in Africa is primarily for bushmeat and traditional medicine (Buij et al. 2016, Williams et al. 2014). However, there is no evidence to suggest that trade of the species is causing significant population decline."

    "threats_description": "Rapid deforestation is ongoing across the species's range, largely for conversion to crops and pastureland, as well as for road-building. The species occurs in a wide variety of habitat, is tolerant of forest fragmentation and is able to persist in very small forest fragments (dos Anjos 2006, del Hoyo and Kirwan 2020). In Minas Gerais, it was recorded at higher abundances in secondary forest than in primary forest (Loures-Ribeiro et al. 2011). The impact of deforestation on the species is not well-known, and the species could conceivably benefit from habitat modification in some areas (A. Lees in litt. 2021). However, it requires some tree coverage and so it is likely to be impacted by tree cover loss eventually.Additionally, it is widely hunted for food (Peres et al. 2003, Ribon et al. 2003, del Hoyo and Kirwan 2020), including in protected areas in Argentina (C. I. Mi\u00f1o in litt. 2021). Surveys in central Amazonia found that the abundance of Penelope spp. (including both Penelope superciliaris and P. pileata) was lower in hunted sites than in unhunted sites (Peres et al. 2003), and surveys in the Atlantic Forest in Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil found that the species's detectability was negatively affected by poaching intensity (Pereira-Ribeiro et al. 2018). In Paraguay, it has disappeared from most forest fragments that experience hunting pressure (P. Smith in litt. 2021). Conversely, surveys in Sao Paulo, Brazil, found that the species's abundance was not related to hunting pressure (Cullen Jr. et al. 2000), and a study at an indigenous reserve in southeast Amazonia found that hunting was at sustainable levels (Peres and Nascimento 2006). The impact of hunting is considered to be negligible across much of the species's range in southern Brazil, but there may be local impacts (A. Lees in litt. 2021)."

    "threats_description": "By mid-2000, Gyps vultures were being found dead and dying in Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported (Prakash et al. 2003, 2007, Gilbert et al. 2006). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality. Vultures are exposed to diclofenac and other NSAIDs through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that had been treated prior to death (often as part of palliative care) and left for scavengers to consume. Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs which then cause renal failure resulting in visceral gout in the vast majority of examined vultures (Oaks et al. 2004a, Shultz et al. 2004, Green et al. 2004, Swan et al. 2006b, Gilbert et al. 2006, Cuthbert et al. 2014). Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in Gyps vultures, just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues (Green et al. 2004); and sampling carcasses of livestock in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart et al. 2009). Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality and diclofenac being banned in several range states, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations (Paudel 2008), potentially leading to a slower uptake of meloxicam, an alternative veterinary drug that is of low toxicity to vultures and which has been promoted as a safe alternative to diclofenac in the region (Swan et al. 2006a, Swarup et al. 2007). Additionally, large vials of diclofenac continue to be manufactured for human use, which are then distributed, sold and used for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert et al. 2011, T. Galligan in litt. 2016). A second veterinary drug in use in India and particularly in Bangladesh, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that they are present in sufficient concentrations to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo et al. 2010). Additionally, aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac, which is converted to diclofenac in cattle (Galligan et al. 2016), and is therefore as toxic to vultures as diclofenac itself. Wild vultures have also been found dead in India with visceral gout and residues of the veterinary NSAID nimesulide in their tissues (Cuthbert et al. 2016; Nambirajan et al. in prep. 2021). This combination has only been found previously for gout and diclofenac, and therefore provides a strong indication that nimesulide is also toxic to vultures (C. Bowden in litt. 2016). The availability of other NSAIDs, including ketoprofen and nimesulide, is increasing (Cuthbert et al. 2011b, Khan 2013, C. Bowden in litt. 2016). Flunixin is another NSAID that has been associated with visceral gout in vultures (Zorrilla et al. 2015), though it is not commonly in use in South Asia yet (T. Galligan in litt. 2016). One study recorded that the sex of fledglings, the sex of dead adults and the sex of adults with visceral gout were all male-biased which may lead to problems in the future (Arshad et al. 2009).Other likely contributory factors in South Asia are changes in human consumption and processing of dead livestock (which have occurred in response to the collapse in vulture numbers) and poison and pesticide use, but these are probably of more minor significance (C. Bowden in litt. 2016). In Bangladesh, 61% of cattle owners surveyed said that they now buried dead cattle or used them as food in shrimp farms, which could lead to a reduction in food supply for vultures (Khan 2013). Forest fires may also be a threat in some areas, for instance in the Himalayas, though this may need further study (M. Thakur in litt. 2016). Deforestation, electrocution and collision with energy infrastructure may pose additional threats in some parts of the range (Botha et al. 2017).In South-East Asia, the near-total disappearance of the species pre-dated the present crisis, and probably resulted from the collapse of large wild ungulate populations and improved management of deceased livestock reducing food availability (Clements et al. 2013). In Cambodia, vultures are still threatened by extremely low population densities of wild ungulates, a decline in the number of free-ranging domestic ungulates, felling of nesting trees for timber and accidental poisoning at carcasses laced with pesticides to kill stray dogs and for hunting wildlife (Loveridge et al. 2019; Clements et al. 2013; S. Mahood in litt. 2012). Loveridge et al (2019) recorded 15 vulture poisoning events in Cambodia during 2005-2016, resulting in the known deaths of 32 White-rumped Vultures. The same study also recorded the first confirmed vulture mortality from carbofuran in Cambodia. Additional threats identified in Myanmar include direct persecution of the species through nest destruction, hunting and poisoning and indirectly through a loss of food supply (Hla et al. 2011)."

    "threats_description": "Rapid declines in the southern forest and forest-steppe zones of Russia and Ukraine are largely a result of the destruction and deterioration of nesting habitats. The main causes of habitat loss are conversion to intensive agriculture (K\u00e5l\u00e5s et al. 1997), wetland drainage (including polders) (Mongin, 2008; Luiguj\u00f5e in litt.) and the submergence of river valleys during the creation of reservoirs. Habitat overgrowth due to land abandonment and eutrophication may be a considerable threat in the eastern population (J. A. K\u00e5l\u00e5s in litt. 2016; M. Korniluk in litt. 2016; Mongin &amp; Davidyonok, 2019). Lek extinction in Belarus has been attributed to changes in vegetation structure of breeding habitats and overgrowth of floodplain meadows, probably related to decline in livestock and the cessation of grazing (Mongin &amp; Davidyonok, 2019). Another negative result of the overgrowth of abandoned farmlands is large-scale spring fires, usually at the end of April through the first half of May (Mischenko in press). Korniluk (2021) has suggested that this species may be falling into an ecological trap: suitable habitat for breeding males requires intensive land management (early mowing and extensive grazing) that will destroy a significant proportion of the broods. Furthermore, intensive grassland management in the vicinity of leks increases foraging sites, which, by attracting breeding males and producing larger leks, attracts more females to a habitat unfit for broods. Current habitat selection may be causing reduced productivity due to reduced suitability for brood survival, and may therefore lead to population declines. It is also hunted in eastern Europe and in its wintering range (C. Z\u00f6ckler in litt. 2015), with reports of several thousands killed in just 15-20 days in Amasia, Armenia (L. Balyan in litt. 2008). Brochet et al., (2019) estimates 1% of the EU27 population are illegally killed/taken in EU member states, of which Denmark ranks highest. Habitat loss due to climate change may represent the most severe threat to the Scandinavian population (R. Ekblom in litt. 2007, J. A. K\u00e5l\u00e5s in litt. 2007)."

    "threats_description": "Pollution is a threat that still needs to be controlled within the species's range to keep the current population stable (Kear 2005b). Hybridisation of the species with the Northern Mallard Anas platyrhynchos represents a threat to the integrity of the species (Hockey, et al. 2005, Kear 2005b, Owen, et al. 2006) because the two species hybridise easily and produce fertile progeny (Owen, et al. 2006). Northern Mallard Anas platyrhynchos was introduced both deliberately and accidentally into the Cape Provinces of South Africa and has since become naturalised (Owen, et al. 2006). Other exotic ducks may associate with the species (e.g. Laysan Teal at Gauteng Province) and these species pose a further potential threat (Owen, et al. 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian botulism, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Blaker 1967). Utilisation The species is hunted (Dean and Skead 1989, Little, et al. 1995, Kear 2005b), and although there is no current evidence that such activities pose a threat to the species (Dean and Skead 1989), hunting levels may still need to be controlled in order to maintain current population levels (Kear 2005b). The species is also traded at traditional medicine markets in Nigeria (Nikolaus 2001)."

    "threats_description": "This species is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as increased sea surface temperature (SST) and associated shifts in prey (e.g. Herring, Sandeel) distribution, abundance and quality (Durant et al. 2003, Sandvik et al. 2005). Breeding failures are usually assumed to be due to food shortages (e.g. Martin 1989, Anker-Nilssen and Aarvak 2006, Harris and Wanless 2011, Anker-Nilssen et al. 2016), as changing temperatures can cause mismatches between plankton blooms, prey abundance peaks and Puffin breeding seasons, leading to poor chick growth, shortened nesting periods and lower fledging success (Durant et al. 2006). Sandvik et al. (2005) demonstrated decreased survival in North Atlantic seabirds (including the puffin) with increasing SST. There are several recorded examples of food stock collapse and its detrimental consequences for Puffins; The Sandeel population collapse near Shetland in 1985-1990 led to successive years of breeding failures (Mitchell et al. 2004), and another Sandeel crash in South and West Iceland and the Faroes in 2003-2005 led to food scarcity and collapse of Puffin populations with some colonies having 0% breeding success (Hansen and Sigurdsson in litt. 2016). Extreme weather and storms can cause mass mortality of seabirds, with large wrecks recorded following severe winter storms at sea, and represents a potentially growing threat due to the predicted increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (Melillo et al. 2014). In Pop Witless Bay, extreme cold and wet weather in 2011 caused the death of thousands of chicks across Witless Bay Reserve (Wilhelm et al. 2015). A severe wreck in March 2016 also delayed breeding on Isle of May (Newell 2016). The 2002 Norway wreck could have caused the death of as many as 100,000 birds, diagnosed as prolonged exposure to adverse feeding conditions at sea (but may also have been caused by disease or climatic factors affecting prey abundance) (Anker-Nilssen et al. 2013). A large wreck occurred in March 2013 along the coast of Scotland/northeastern UK, also coinciding with periods of extreme weather (3,055 and 1,364 birds collected on Scottish and English coast, respectively), where the majority died of starvation, likely due to difficulty feeding at sea (Harris and Elkins 2013). Productivity fell to 0.46 in the Farne islands in 2015 due to flooding caused by two major storms that destroyed nests with chicks (Wildlife review 2015). More such examples have been recorded throughout the species\u2019 range. The threat of climate change to food stocks is exacerbated by the unsustainable harvesting of prey species by commercial fisheries, causing further reductions in food availability and subsequent low breeding success (Breton and Diamond 2014). Major fisheries have been noted as contributing to the collapse of key prey fish species since the 1960s and been linked to reproductive failure at colonies such as R\u00f8st, Norway (reduced recruitment due to food shortage in breeding season is considered the most likely cause of decline during 1986-2012) (Tasker et al. 2000, Anker-Nilssen et al. 2003, Miles et al. 2015). In addition to overharvesting of prey stocks, commercial fisheries are a cause of direct mortality. The Atlantic Puffin\u2019s foraging strategy (diving) makes the species susceptible to being caught in gillnets and other fishing gear, but bycatch has not been recorded in significantly large numbers (Tasker et al. 2000, Rogan and Mackey 2007) and likely has a \u201ctrivial effect\u201d on Puffin populations (Harris and Wanless 2011). At the breeding colonies, the species is vulnerable to invasive predators. American Mink Neovison vison is known to take puffins from burrows, and the escape of mink from fur farms in Iceland in the early 1930s drove many colonies to extinction in the following decades (Harris and Wanless 2011). Mink are still causing low rates of chick survival in parts of the range, including Horn\u00f8ya, Norway (Barrett 2015). Rats Rattus spp. depredate eggs and chicks and have been linked to drastic colony declines and local extinctions in Sweden (Harris and Wanless 2011), on the Faroe Islands (Stempniewicz and Jensen 2007), Lundy Island (Lock 2006), Shiant Islands (Lockley 1953), and Ailsa Craig and Puffin Islands (Mitchell et al. 2004) (see also TemaNord 2010). Recolonisation and population recovery can be seen after rat eradication (Lock 2006). Hunting of puffins, mostly for human consumption, is allowed on the Faeroe Islands and Iceland (Thorup et al. 2014), yet uncontrolled harvesting in nesting grounds may lead to local declines. Adult birds are taken during the nesting season, thus causing reduced reproductive success and significant adult mortality, in addition to the general effects of disturbance. 10,000 individuals were recorded to be taken annually in the N\u00f3lsoy colony (Faeroes) and 150,000 in Iceland. This is suspected to limit recovery of populations and may exceed recruitment rate on Iceland, while the N\u00f3lsoy population is considered stable only due to migration (Stempniewicz and Jensen 2007). The species is particularly vulnerable to disturbance when nesting, and human intrusion associated with other recreational activities (tourism, walks) may also impact the species. Nest desertions have been recorded (Nettleship et al. 2014), and at one study site a 40% decrease in breeding success was seen in a frequently visited area compared to the control site (Rodway et al. 1996). The species is also vulnerable to oil spills and other forms of marine pollution. Past oil spills have had severe impacts on affected puffin populations; the wreck of the Torrey Canyon in 1967 was linked to decline in puffin numbers at Sept-Iles (Brittany) and the wreck of the oil tanker Amoco Cadiz (1978) badly affected moulting puffins in the region, killing 1,391 confirmed puffins which coincided with a 44% reduction in the Sept-Iles population. The number of Puffins killed is likely an underestimate, as many will not be recovered or identified on beaches after wrecks (Harris and Wanless 2011). Oiled puffins are often unable to fly, accentuating the effects of reduced food supplies and extreme weather preventing feeding. However, other oil spills seem to have had less effect on Puffin populations; the Tricolor spill in 2003 (Netherlands) was not found to have been a major cause of a local puffin wreck (35% of birds were oiled, most after death) (Camphuysen 2003). Nonetheless, the greatest impact of oil spills is likely to be on long-term condition of adults and ecosystem degradation, imposing a further risk to the Atlantic Puffin\u2019s food resources. Various incidences of other marine pollutants have been recorded in the species; in 1970 21% of carcasses found in Scotland, and 22% of those shot off the coast of Norway contained elastic threads and other plastic particles (nylon thread, plastic beads etc). Given that the same proportion of pollutants were measured in healthy and deceased Puffins on Isle of May, pollution is regarded unlikely to be the primary cause of death, but may still pose a risk by accumulating over time and accentuating other threats for individuals already compromised by low food availability, adverse climatic conditions or hunting. The highest proportion of pollutants were found in first year birds, which may be explained by higher mortality among young birds with higher loads and only the less polluted birds reaching adulthood (Harris and Wanless 2011). Increasing numbers of offshore windfarms could result in displacement, but the risk of collision is considered very low (Bradbury et al. 2014). However, a study into puffin vision suggests they may be vulnerable to collision with man-made objects related to underwater wind farms (Martin and Wanless 2015)."

    "threats_description": "Introduced mammals poses the greatest threat to the population, with cats Felis catus and rats Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus being present throughout the species\u2019s range. Rats have invaded at least three of the Japanese breeding islands, with current impacts largely unknown, but likely to affect fledgling success and egg predation (Lee 2010). The shearwaters appear to suffer significant impacts from rats on Mikura-Jima, which is populated by c.300 people and is popular with tourists, thus making an eradication programme problematic and the subsequent reintroduction of rats more likely (Oka et al. 2002, J. Croxall in litt. 2011). Feral cats may also be inflicting increasing mortality on the Mikura-Jima population through predation on chicks, young birds and adults (N. Oka per M. Sato in litt. 2012, S. Uematsu in litt. 2012). Efforts are being taken to capture and neuter feral cats, however due to pressure from the public, cats are hard to eliminate. Currently, climate change is affecting foraging distribution and hence energetic budgets of adults. It is further predicted that whole colonies may be affected in the future as prey populations shift distribution in response to climate change. In addition to these threats, the species is also susceptible to fisheries bycatch (Birds Korea 2010, J. Croxall in litt. 2011), but the impact has not been quantified. Research suggests the Fukushima nuclear accident may have had negative impacts on birds breeding on Mikura Island, with reduced vitamin A levels detected in chicks following the release of radioactive material (Uematsu et al. 2014). The researchers suggest that additional negative impacts may be expected in the population in the future."

    "threats_description": "In Europe since the early part of the 20th century, the species may have declined in all 31 countries in which it is found. In the U.K., the reduction in numbers is believed to be as high as 80%; causes probably include factors such as loss of nesting cover, predation, herbicides (chick survival rates in U.K. declined from 49% to 32% once their use became widespread) and pesticides that reduce insect abundance in the spring. All of these factors are the consequences of intensification of agricultural practices (Carroll et al. 2020), causing significant stressors despite the species' adaptability to agricultural habitats. Abandoning low-intensive agriculture, and therefore rewilding areas are also known to cause local declines (Novoa et al. 2002). The species is also hunted in many parts of Europe and is considered an economically important gamebird (Carroll et al. 2020). Changes in weather patterns may also have a significant impact on numbers (such as severe winters causing increased mortality; Potts 1986, Panek 1990, Carroll et al. 2020); exact extent of impacts are however currently unknown."

    "threats_description": "Nesting areas are vulnerable to flooding, predation and disturbance (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In a 2017-2019 study in Odisha, India, flooding, predation and cyclones were the main threats (Debrata 2019, Kar et al. in prep). Local fishermen also report that children collect eggs and chicks from sandbanks, which may pose a substantial threat to ground-nesting birds. Strangling of chicks in discarded fish nets is being recorded at different areas and may pose a growing risk (Narwade and Fartade 2013, Reshamwala 2017). Sand and gold mining is an emerging threat for breeding colonies of Indian Skimmer, with which the River Tern nests and is thought to have a long-term effect on nesting-island formation (Das 2015, Shaikh et al. 2018, Debata et al. 2019, C. Z\u00f6ckler in litt. 2020). Poor water level management along rivers are additionally affecting the stability of colonies (T. Mundkur in litt. 2020). In several places in India, human disturbance, encroachment of wetlands by cities, disturbance by photographers and birdwatchers, egg and chick trampling by domestic water buffalo and Chital deer is common (Amoghavarsha 2013, S. Subramanya in litt. 2020). Future plans for water transportation routes on the Ayeyawady, and dredging on the Chindwin River for commercial and passenger transport may further create localised threats (C. Z\u00f6ckler in litt. 2020). Predation of eggs and chicks by a variety of terrestrial animals including domestic dogs, Lesser Bandicoot Rat (Bandicota bengalensis), Monitor Lizard (Varanus salvator; Mundkur 1991), and avian predators including House Crow (Corvus splendens; Siddiqui et al. 2007), Black-headed Ibis (Threskiornis melanocephalus; Parimala 2013, Reshamwala 2017), Pallas\u2019s Fishing Eagle (Haliaeetus leucophus; Lowther 1949) and Bonelli's Eagle (Aquila fasciata; Belur 2014) may be taking their toll. Invasive plants such as Mimosa pigra may also reduce nest success and chick survival (Claassen et al. 2018). The negative population trend in Laos is probably due mainly to excessive human disturbance on sandbars (Thewlis et al. 1998). In Nepal, it is threatened by food shortage, illegal and over-fishing in protected areas, destruction of breeding habitats on rivers, disturbance and hunting (K. Bhusal in litt. 2020). In Cambodia, a study of breeding colonies in 2010-2015 found that egg collection, predation by rodents, crows and domestic dogs and trampling by domestic water buffalo were responsible for low breeding success (Claassen et al. 2017, J. C. Eames in litt. 2018). The study found very little evidence of direct hunting of the species, although a snare was once found at a nest (A. Claassen in litt. 2016). The multitude of dam construction projects completed, underway or planned in South-East Asia (e.g. along the Mekong river [F. Goes in litt. 2011]) may also threaten the species through changes to flow regime and flooding of nest-sites. Dams along the Sesan river in Vietnam have precipitated the decline and led to near-extirpation of the species downstream in Cambodia (F. Goes in litt. 2020). Its habitat may be threatened by the construction of dams in the Dayingjiang region of south-western Yunnan (Yang Liu in litt. 2011, Dasgupta 2019). In Nepal it is severely threatened by food shortages owing to illegal fishing inside protected areas and overfishing outside protected areas, it is also threatened by destruction of breeding habitat, disturbance and hunting (Inskipp et al. 2016). In Myanmar, planned developments may potentially threaten the species in the future (C. Z\u00f6ckler in litt. 2020). Breeding sites along the Indus River (passing between the plains of Punjab and Sindh provinces) are threatened with encroachment and conflict, as well as agricultural expansion leading to increases in human settlements and live stock (M. Ali in litt. 2020)."

    "threats_description": "Loss of prairie habitat through conversion to cropland was primarily responsible for the extinction of T. c. cupido and declines in the other two subspecies. Grazing pressure from sheep and the increase in cropland throughout areas of native prairie is threatening the remaining population of T. c. attwateri in Texas. Habitat fragmentation leading to isolated populations and a loss of genetic variance and subsequent decreases in fertility will reduce fitness and reinforce negative demographic trends (Westemeier et al. 1998). In certain states hunting continues (Schroeder and Robb 1993). The species may suffer from competition with Ring-necked Pheasant Phasianus colchicus (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Noise from roads and wind turbines were found to negatively affect the propagation distance of boom calls at leks (Raynor et al. 2017)."

    "threats_description": "Populations were greatly reduced by feather and egg collecting in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and by high seas drift nets for squid and salmon that were active between 1978 and 1992. Prior to its closure, the high seas driftnet fishery killed over 17,500 Laysan Albatross in 1990 alone (Johnson et al. 1993). Current key threats include incidental capture in pelagic (Crowder and Myers 2002) and demersal longline fisheries (Stehn et al. 2001) in the North Pacific as well as in illegal high seas driftnet operations. Analyses in 2001 estimated that pelagic longliners in the North Pacific may kill 5,000-18,000 Phoebastria immutabilis per year, with 8,000 thought the most likely figure, while demersal longline operations in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries were estimated to kill c.715 birds per year (Crowder and Myers 2001). It has been recently estimated that on average, 156 Phoebastria immutabilis are taken annually in the Alaskan federal groundfish and Pacific Halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis fisheries, (in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, and the Gulf of Alaska Fishery Management Plan areas), targeting Pacific Cod Gadus macrocephalus, Sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, and Halibut Hippoglossus spp.. Off Canada\u2019s west coast, the estimated annual bycatch mortality of albatrosses (primarily Black-footed Albatross) averages 85 birds per year (range 25-128) (COSEWIC 2013, K. Morgan, unpublished data, 2016). The bycatch rates in Japanese and Taiwanese pelagic longline fisheries in the North Pacific are still largely unknown. Climate change poses an ongoing threat in terms of storms and flooding, and a future threat in terms of habitat alteration from sea-level rise. A majority of the population nests on low-lying islands and atolls and it is predicted that with climate change and the resulting rise in sea-level, there will be significant inundation and loss nesting habitat (Storlazzi et al. 2013, Reynolds et al. 2015). Other threats include pollution from oil spills, organochlorine, lead and plastic ingestion, as well as invasive species, human disturbance and conflicts with aircrafts (Harrison 1990, Ludwig et al. 1998, Finkelstein et al. 2003, Finkelstein 2006, Young et al. 2014). Chicks with large volumes of proventricular plastic have been reported to have fledging weights significantly lower than chicks with low amounts of plastic, and there is some evidence to suggest it may have affected survival rates in 1986, when the volume of plastic ingestion was at its highest (Sievert and Sileo 2008). Up to 10,000 chicks per year are potentially affected by lead poisoning from paint on buildings at Midway Atoll (Finkelstein 2006), and 7% of chicks on Sand Island fail to fledge from lead poisoning each year, with a predicted impact of 16% reduction in population size over the course of 50 years equating to 190,000 fewer birds (Finkelstein et al. 2010). Avian pox virus affects chicks on Midway and the Main Hawaiian Islands where introduced mosquitoes are present, but the associated declines are negligible (VanderWerf and Young 2016). Invasive predators also pose a threat. Dogs Canis lupus familiaris kill adults and chicks on inhabited islands in Hawaii. Observations from Guadalupe Island, Mexico, in December 2002 recorded that, of the 490 adults on the island, 35 were killed by feral cats Felis catus (7% of the total island breeding population that year, and 30% of the Punta Sur colony) (Keitt et al. 2006). Cats were also responsible for a tripling in nest failure rate at this colony (49%) compared with the nearby cat free Negro Islet colony (13%) (Keitt et al. 2006). Cat control around the colony from Jan-Mar 2003 removed 18 cats and curtailed adult mortality from cat predation, although cats continued to be seen around the colony after the breeding season ended (Keitt et al. 2006). It is likely that the population here had not experienced high levels of predation prior to 2002, as otherwise it would have been extirpated. Other introduced predators (notably the Polynesian rat Rattus exulans; Jones et al. 2008) may pose a minor threat to colonies in Mexico and on the Main Hawaiian Islands. Rats have been recorded killing adults on rare occasions, but this mortality is minimal and hence not believed to be driving significant declines. House mice Mus musculus on Sand Island began attacking adult Laysan Albatross in 2015, with the behaviour spreading rapidly in the following breeding season. An eradication is planned and trapping around the colony has minimised chick losses. In 2002, observations on Clarion Island, Mexico, reported zero breeding success from the 46 nesting pairs, largely as a result of predation by several endemic species (e.g. Clarion Raven Corvus corax clarionensis and Clarion Racer Masticophis anthonyi; Wanless et al. 2009)."

    "threats_description": "Breeding sites are threatened primarily by intensive forestry in the mountains, and by the shortage of large indigenous trees in the lowlands (e.g. illegal tree cutting affected several pairs in Russia [Karyakin et al. 2009a] and Bulgaria). The species is sensitive to human disturbance, which means its breeding range can be highly restricted by human presence and infrastructural development in Central Europe (and probably elsewhere in its range e.g. Karyakin 2011) (M. Horv\u00e1th in litt. 2016). Infrastructural and settlement network was the primary cause for the absence of the species at more than 30% of its potential habitats at the Hungarian Plain (Horv\u00e1th 2009). Other threats are loss and alteration of feeding habitats, shortages of small and medium-sized prey species (particularly ground-squirrels Spermophilus spp.), nest robbing and illegal trade, shooting, poisoning, electrocution by powerlines and collisions with vehicles. An average of c.450 Eastern Imperial Eagles were killed by powerlines during the 2009 breeding season in the Altai region \u2013 25% of the total population of the region (Karyakin et al. 2009b). Habitat alterations associated with agricultural expansion threaten historical and potential breeding sites in former range countries. In Central Europe intentional predator poisoning became the first cause of mortality from 2006 onwards affecting more than 80 specimens in 10 years only in Hungary (Horv\u00e1th et al. 2011, M. Horv\u00e1th in litt. 2016). Hunting, poisoning, prey depletion and other mortality factors are also likely to pose threats along migration routes and in wintering areas. Competition for nest sites with Greater Spotted Eagle Aquila clanga has been reported in the Altai region, Russia (Karyakin et al. 2009c)."

    "threats_description": "Major threats to this species include non-targeted poisoning, capture for traditional medicine and bushmeat (McKean et al. 2013), and direct persecution (Ogada and Buij 2011, Ogada et al. 2016, Henriques 2020). In Nigeria, a survey of medicinal traders found that Hooded Vulture was the most commonly traded species of vulture, with 90% of all vulture parts traded belonging to the species (Saidu and Buij 2013, Williams et al. 2021a), and both deliberate and unintentional poisoning remains on the increase despite general local awareness (Owolabi et al. 2020). Across West and central Africa the species is one of the most heavily traded, with an estimated 5,850-8,772 individuals traded over a six-year period in West Africa (Buij et al. 2016). Hooded Vulture meat is reportedly sold as chicken in some places (Ogada and Buij 2011, Buij et al. 2016). Trade for vulture parts has almost completely extirpated vultures from parts of their range, for example in Edo State, southern Nigeria (Nosazeogie et al. 2018). In the world's largest vulture poisoning incident to date, more than 2,000 vultures, most of which were Hooded Vultures, were killed in Guinea Bissau at the beginning of 2020, believed to have been driven by demand for body parts for belief-based use (BirdLife International 2020, Henriques et al. 2020). It now appears that there is considerable cross-border trade in vulture parts, with poisoning incidents also recently noted in the Gambia as well as further incidents in Guinea Bissau (D. Ogada in litt. 2022b). Intentional poisoning of vultures may be carried out in some areas by poachers in order to hide the locations of their kills. In 2018 seven Hooded Vultures were killed at an elephant carcass in Mozambique that had been laced with carbofuran by a poacher (SSC 2018), and in 2019 28 Hooded Vultures were killed at three poisoned elephant carcasses in Botswana (BirdGuides 2019). In Senegal vultures receive a form of cultural protection from such killing because they are the totem for some families (B. Bargain in litt. 2016). Secondary poisoning with pesticides at livestock baits being used to poison mammalian predators and feral dogs is also an issue in East Africa (Otieno et al. 2010, C. Kendall in litt. 2012, Roxburgh and McDougall 2012) and parts of West Africa (Mulli\u00e9 et al. 2017). Despite diclofenac being found on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2008) and marketed, it is not thought that this has been directly affecting the species significantly.Declines have also been attributed to land conversion through development and improvements to abattoir hygiene and rubbish disposal in some areas (Ogada and Buij 2011), and, in Senegal, a decline in the number of their favourite nesting tree species (B. Bargain in litt. 2016, Mulli\u00e9 et al. 2017). The species may also be threatened by avian influenza (H5N1), from which it appears to suffer some mortality and which it probably acquires from feeding on discarded dead poultry (Ducatez et al. 2007), although this is not well substantiated (C. Kendall in litt. 2016). In Burkina Faso, the main anthropogenic threats to reproductive output are poaching of eggs, chicks and collection of nesting materials and pruning of nest trees (Dabone et al. 2019). According to questionnaires conducted primarily with abattoir workers in Uganda, electrocution and collision with power lines may be a significant cause of mortality (Magin 2017)."

    "threats_description": "The species is clearly adapted for exceptionally low mortality and reproductive output, and is therefore highly vulnerable to negative demographic events including human persecution, which persists across its range owing to alleged attacks on livestock (Houston 1994, Cailly Arnulphi et al. 2017). Observations in the last decade or so have confirmed that individuals occasionally attack the soft body parts of juvenile domestic cattle (N. Rios per R. Wallace 2004, H. Vargas and F. S\u00e1enz pers. obs. per R. Wallace in litt. 2020). Intensive observations in the field show that this appears to be an extremely rare event that represents less than 1% of the mortalities of livestock (Ballejo et al. 2020). In addition, the persecution of mountain lions and foxes through the illegal poisoning of carcasses is seriously affecting the species in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and probably Bolivia (Pavez and Estades 2016, Alarc\u00f3n and Lambertucci 2018, Pauli et al. 2018, Piana 2019, Estrada Pacheco et al. 2020, F. S\u00e1enz and D. M\u00e9ndez per R. Wallace in litt. 2020, G. Wiemeyer in litt. 2020). This threat is increasing in intensity. By early 2020, species experts had systematized 225 individuals across the range, with about 50% of recorded cases resulting in mortality, although this percentage is biased by rescue centre animals and mortality rates are likely higher, as many dead poisoning victims are almost certainly not detected or reported across the range.The species is highly dependent on the carcasses of exotic herbivores in Argentina, which form 98.5% of their diet, making them vulnerable to changes in livestock raising and to the consumption of hunting ammunition (Lambertucci et al. 2009). Interspecific competition for carcasses with American Black Vulture Coragyps atratus, which have recently begun to occupy the same areas, may have a deleterious effect on Andean Condor populations (Carrete et al. 2010, Ballejo et al. 2018). Similarly, a number of studies have revealed the significance of other threats to the species including lead poisoning (Lambertucci et al. 2011, Wiemeyer et al. 2017, Plaza et al. 2020), illegal use in folkloric events (Piana 2014, 2019), illegal wildlife trade (Williams et al. 2011), use as pets (Pavez and Estades 2016), collisions with electrical and telecommunication infrastructure (S. Lambertucci pers. obs.) and competition with feral dogs (D. M\u00e9ndez and H. Vargas pers. obs.). Habitat is lost through the conversion of natural vegetation for agricultural use and plantations (H. Vargas in litt. 2020)."

    "threats_description": "Shortage of food due to commercial overfishing is one of the primary threats to this species (Crawford et al. 1992a, 2007, 2014, 2015, 2016), a result of competition with the South African purse-seine fishery for anchovy and sardine, which are essential prey items. The positive trends in two cormorant spp. that do not compete with fisheries for prey (Phalacrocorax lucidus, Microcarbo coronatus), contrasted by the negative trends in species that do (P. capensis, P. neglectus) supports the role of fishing in causing population declines via reduced prey availability (Crawford 2015). Oil pollution is a threat which has had severe impacts on the population in the past and is likely to strike again. The species\u2019 foraging behaviour makes it highly vulnerable to oiling and it responds poorly to rehabilitation efforts. On past occasions, spillage of fish oils caused mass mortality of cormorants. The best-documented case (Walvis Bay, 1974) recorded more than 4,500 fatalities, principally due to starvation resulting from loss of flight ability (Kemper and Simmons 2015). Predation by Great White Pelican Pelecanus onocrotalus, Fur Seal Arctocephalus pusillus, Sacred Ibis Threskiornis aethiopicus and Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus are major causes of mortality for Cape Cormorants. De Ponte Machado (2007) reports increasing levels of depredation of cormorant nests by Great White Pelicans on Malgas, Jutten and Schaapen islands, South Africa, leading to whole-colony abandonment in some cases. Observations of pelicans prospecting in locations where they were previously unrecorded, suggest that pelican predation is an increasing threat. Fur Seal predation on fledglings has also increased since conservation measures were put in place to protect the seal (David et al. 2003), and has been found to represent a significant mortality factor for cormorant fledglings on Dyer Island, South Africa (24%) (Marks et al. 1997, Makhado et al. 2013) and Ichaboe Island, Namibia (Du Toit et al. 2004). Scared Ibis is another major predator of eggs and chicks, taking an estimated 960 cormorant eggs and chicks in one season on Penguin Island and removing a significant proportion of the local population\u2019s potential productivity (Williams and Ward 2006). Voorbergen et al. (2012) recorded c. 5% fledgling mortality by Kelp Gulls on Dyer Island, but regarded this as an underestimate of actual predation levels. Climate change displaces critical forage resources to the south and east, causing a mismatch in the distribution of cormorant breeding sites and the location of their prey (Crawford et al. 2015). Although the species may move between breeding localities (Crawford et al. 1994), they also show fidelity to natal and nest sites (Berry 1977, Hockey et al. 2005). In 1992, Avian Cholera Pasteurella multocida was deemed responsible for the death of 14,500 Cape Cormorants on eight studied islands, amounting to 8% of the breeding population in these colonies. Mortality rates as high as 16% (of breeding population) were recorded and among the six cholera outbreaks recorded in 1940, Cape Cormorants were the species that experienced greatest mortality (Crawford et al. 1992a, Barnes 2000, Waller and Underhill 2007). Guano mining is another threat that has had adverse effects on the species in the past and is likely to return. Cape Cormorant is one of the main producers of seabird guano in southern Africa and is therefore highly susceptible to disturbance from mining activities (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Crawford 2007)."

At present, persecution continues on a much lower level, but may still be limiting the size of some colonies.

    "threats_description": "The most pertinent threat to this species is illegal direct poisoning to kill predators of livestock and game animals (targetting foxes, wolves, corvids etc.) and indirect poisoning from pesticides and secondary poisoning from consumption of poisoned rodents by rodenticides spread on farmland to control vole plagues, particularly in the wintering ranges in France and Spain, where it may drive rapid population declines (e.g. see Villafuerte et al. 1998, Mougeot et al. 2011, A. Aebischer in litt. 2009); there has been reported a strong correlation between rapid declines and those populations that winter in Spain (Carter 2007). An estimate of 430-1,800 individuals killed illegally in Spain annually indicates that this remains a significant problem for birds that do migrate and for the regional population (Brochet et al. 2016). The Spanish government released more than 1,500 tons of rodenticide-treated baits over about 500,000 ha to fight against a common vole plague in agricultural lands between August 2007 and April 2008; records of Red Kites dying by secondary poisoning in treated areas resulted (J. Vi\u00f1uela in litt. 2009). The total of recovered, confirmed poisoning cases in Spain is 1,187 individuals found dead between 1992 and 2015 (Cano et al. 2016). In north Scotland, 40% of birds found dead between 1989 and 2006 were found to have been killed by poisoning (Smart et al. 2010).In France populations disappeared at the same rate as conversion from grasslands to cereal crops (P. Tourret in litt. 2009). The decline of grazing livestock and farming intensification leading to chemical pollution, homogenization of landscapes and ecological impoverishment also threatens the species (Knott et al. 2009). Wind turbines are a potentially serious threat (Duchamp 2003, Mammen et al. 2009, Schaub 2012, P. Tourret in litt. 2009); 18 Red Kite were located having been killed by collisions with windfarms in 2019 (F. David in litt. 2020). Other less significant threats include electrocution and collision with powerlines (Mionnet 2007, P. Tourret in litt. 2009), hunting and trapping (Mionnet 2007, P. Tourret in litt. 2009), road-kills, deforestation, egg-collection (on a local scale) (Ferguson-Lees et al. 2001, Mammen 2007, Cardiel and Vi\u00f1uela 2007). Another factor implicated in the declines in France and Spain is a decrease in the number of rubbish dumps (Mionnet 2007, Cardiel and Vi\u00f1uela 2007)."

Continuing development of natural gas resources is causing reduced lek attendance and overall population (Holloran and Anderson 2005). Coyote Canis latrans control is likely to have a detrimental impact on sage grouse owing to the loss of beneficial indirect interactions (Mezquida et al. 2006). In 2003, about 25% of the radio-marked sage-grouse in the Powder River Basin died from West Nile virus. That number dropped to 10% in 2004 and 2% in 2005 in response to cool summer temperatures, but the long-term impacts require further study. There have been large-scale losses of sagebrush habitat owing to changes in fire frequencies resulting from cheatgrass proliferation (Holloran in litt. 2007)."

    "threats_description": "The most serious potential threat to this species is thought to be mortality caused through ingestion of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) widely used in livestock, particularly in South Asia. Diclofenac has caused drastic declines in three other Gyps species in South Asia since the early 1990s, owing to kidney failure following ingestion, with clinical signs of extensive visceral gout and renal failure, and the drug also appears to be fatal in G. himalayensis (Das et al. 2010). Veterinary use of diclofenac is less common within the breeding range of G. himalayensis so adults are unlikely to be exposed, but juveniles may be when they migrate to lowland areas of India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan (Das et al. 2010; Bothat et al. 2017). The decline noted in the Upper Mustang region of Nepal in 2002-2005 was thought highly likely to be caused by diclofenac poisoning (Acharya et al. 2009). Since diclofenac was banned in Nepal in 2006, this species has seen partial recovery, at least in part of its range in Nepal, (Paudel et al. 2015) and declines in other Gyps species may have slowed and even reversed (Prakash et al. 2012). However, a wide range of NSAIDs, including one containing diclofenac, were found to be still available for purchase in Mustang District as of February 2012 (R. Acharya per C. Inskipp in litt. 2013). Elsewhere in South Asia, diclofenac use has also decreased, but it remains widely used, thus immature birds dispersing to northern India and Pakistan in winter are still at risk (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral in litt. 2013, K. Paudel and T. Galligan in litt. 2014). Other potential threats include habitat degradation and a shortage of suitable nesting sites (H. Kala in litt. 2013), as well as the ingestion of herbicides, insecticides and fungicides (Acharya et al. 2009). On the Qinghai-Tibet plateau the main threats appear to be chemical control for pika (Ochotona spp.) and the removal of livestock carcasses (X. Lu in litt. 2016). In Thailand lack of natural food sources has been the sole reason for birds (20 juveniles) being admitted to the Kasetsart University Raptor Rehabilitation Unit (C. Kasorndorkbua in litt. 2012). In Pakistan, increased shrub cover due to a decline in winter grass cutting, promotion of stall feeding of livestock and decreasing nomadic pastoralism may be reducing the visibility of carcasses from the air, while reduced livestock numbers may be further limiting food availability (Siddique and Khan 2016). Electrocution or collision with energy infrastructure is likely to be a threat across much of the range, however there is currently little documented evidence (Botha et al. 2017; MaMing and Xu 2015). There is anecdotal evidence of Himalayan Griffons being caught and kept as pets (Sum and Loveridge 2016). In China, vultures may be harvested from the wild and their parts traded for making ornaments and musical instruments (MaMing and Xu 2015)."

    "threats_description": "Population declines have been attributed to food shortages resulting from shifts in the distributions of prey species, competition with commercial purse-seine fisheries and environmental fluctuations (e.g. Crawford et al. 2011). A decrease in foraging effort at St Croix Island (Pichegru et al. 2010, 2012, Sherley et al. 2019b) and an increase in chick survival and chick condition at Robben Island (Sherley et al. 2015, 2018, 2019b) following the establishment of 20 km no-take zones provides some support for this theory. In the early 2000s, there was an eastward shift in sardine and anchovy stocks, with the mature biomass of these species decreasing near the breeding islands north of Cape Town (Crawford et al. 2011). The abundance of these prey species is known to influence foraging success (Campbell et al. 2019, McInnes et al. 2019), breeding success (Crawford et al. 2006, Sherley et al. 2013b), adult survival (Sherley et al. 2014a, Robinson et al. 2015), and juvenile survival (Weller et al. 2016; Sherley et al. 2017), all of which may often be too low off South Africa\u2019s west coast to maintain population equilibrium (Weller et al. 2014, 2016). Western Cape populations declined by 69% between 2001-2009, considered at least partly due to this climate-induced shift in fish stocks. African penguin fledglings travelled to areas of low sea surface temperatures and high chlorophyll-a which were historically reliable cues for fish availability. Climate change and industrial fishing have depleted forage fish in these areas, resulting in an ecological trap for the species and associated low juvenile survival (Sherley et al. 2017). In Namibia, where sardine and anchovy are virtually absent from the foraging ranges of breeding penguins, breeding birds feed principally on the energy-poor Bearded Goby Sufflogobius bibarbatus (Ludynia et al. 2010). Limited penguin mortality in fishing nets may increase if gill-nets are set near colonies (Ellis et al. 1998, Crawford et al. 2017).Human disturbance and egg-collecting were important factors in the decline of the species in the early 20th century (Frost et al. 1976b, Ellis et al. 1998, Shannon and Crawford 1999). While egg collection is now illegal. an incident of egg poaching was recorded in South Africa in 2016 (Brophy 2016). Guano collection was historically a major cause of disturbance at many colonies and the removal of guano deprived penguins of nest-burrowing sites, causing birds to nest on open ground where they are more vulnerable to heat stress resulting in the abandonment of nests, flooding of nests by rain, and increased predation (Frost et al. 1976b, Shannon and Crawford 1999, Pichegru 2013, Kemper 2015). Guano harvesting is no longer practiced in South Africa, and, according to the Namibian Island\u2019s Marine Protected Area Regulations, guano scraping is not permitted following the expiry of existing guano rights for Ichaboe Island in 2016 (MRA 27 of 2000). Both chronic oil pollution and individual large oil spills appear to have long-term significant impacts on colonies. Past mortality from oil spills has been serious (Wolfaardt et al. 2009) and may increase if proposed development of harbours close to colonies proceeds. Most of the population is confined to areas that are near existing or planned major shipping ports (Nel and Whittington 2003, J. Kemper pers. comm.). There has been a dramatic increase in the number of birds oiled since 1990: two individual oil spills (in 1994 and 2000) killed 30,000 individuals, despite successful rehabilitation programmes (Nel and Whittington 2003, Wolfaardt et al. 2008, 2009). Ship to ship bunkering activities off the south east coast in Algoa Bay in 2016 and 2019, resulted in 200 African penguins and 125 seabirds oiled respectively (SANCCOB unpubl. data). Breeding success on Robben Island fell to 0.23 chicks per pair in 2000, compared with an average of 0.62 \u00b10.19 over the other 15 years from 1989 to 2004 (Crawford et al. 2006). Rehabilitation does not necessarily prevent problems in the years after a spill. During 2001-2005, pairs involving at least one bird rehabilitated from the oil spill in 2000 achieved lower fledging success (43%) compared to unaffected pairs (61%) and those involving at least one bird affected by a previous oil spill (71%), mostly owing to higher mortality in older chicks (Barham et al. 2007). This may indicate physiological or behavioural problems that reduce the parents ability to meet the food requirements of older chicks, perhaps owing to the toxicity of the heavy oil in the 2000 spill; the effects of prolonged captivity; or the time between oiling and washing (Barham et al. 2007).The Cape Fur Seal Arctocephalus pusillus competes with penguins for food, displaces them from breeding sites and imposes significant mortality at some colonies (Crawford et al. 1989, Makhado et al. 2013, Weller et al. 2016, MFMR unpubl. data). Modelling of the interaction of multiple pressures on the colonies at Robben and Dyer Islands indicate that predation by Cape Fur Seals is a key driver in current population declines at Dyer Island (Weller et al. 2016). However, this was found to be in addition to immature emigration, suggesting there may be additional bottom-up pressures impacting the viability of colonies.The potential effects of individual storms on breeding colonies at certain sites has been highlighted (de Villiers 2002) and, as such, the increased frequency and severity of storms may cause localised losses. Sharks take some birds at sea and Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus, dogs Canis familiaris and feral cats Felis catus prey on eggs and chicks at colonies (Underhill et al. 2006, Pichegru 2013, Weller et al. 2014, 2016). In some mainland colonies, predation by mongooses Herpestes spp., leopards Panthera pardus and caracals Caracal caracal, or illegal egg collection may have notable impacts (e.g. Underhill et al. 2006), with the Simonstown colony experiencing considerable mortality due to caracal (SANParks and City of Cape Town, unpubl. data, Vanstreels et al. 2019). While a number of diseases have been documented in African penguins, few records of mass mortality through disease have been observed in the wild, up until 2018 and 2019, when a high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain killed approximately 100 penguins in South Africa and up to 600 in Namibia respectively (Khomenko et al. 2018, Molini et al. 2020)"

    "threats_description": "The species has declined in the farmed areas of eastern and southern Africa, apparently as a result of consuming poisoned carcasses. Widespread poisoning of feral dogs in Ethiopia could then prove to be a major problem, in addition to private poisoning (E. Buechley in litt. 2018). In western and north-east Africa declines have been reported but the causes are not known. In general the species\u2019s opportunistic behaviour suggests it is resistant to the usual threats (del Hoyo et al. 1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) although long term changes in rainfall patterns could affect the breeding success of the species in future (Wichmann et al. 2004). In South Africa it has been known to drown in farmland reservoirs (Anderson et al. 1999) and birds have been killed through collisions with power lines (Global Raptor Information Network 2015, E. Buechley in litt. 2018). Direct persecution and collisions with road vehicles when scavenging have also been identified as threats (Global Raptor Information Network 2015, M. Virani in litt. 2018). Accidental poisoning has also been reported (Brown 1991) and while the impact of NSAIDs on this species is not clear, a congener, the Steppe Eagle (Aquila nipalensis), has recently been shown to be affected by diclofenac (Sharma et al. 2014)."

    "threats_description": "Many populations of little penguins are severely threatened by human disturbance such as introduced predators, domestic dogs, roadkill, coastal development, watercraft injuries, oil spills and gillnet fishing in both Australia and New Zealand (Cannel et al. 2016; Chiaradia 2013, Crawford et al. 2017, Dann 2013). Reduction in prey abundance is another major vulnerability to little penguin populations (Cannel et al. 2016; Chiaradia 2013) as well as natural predators such as fur seals and corvids (Ekanayake at al. 2015a,b). Changes in the abundance of major prey can result in a dramatic change in their diet composition and trophic interactions, resulting in increased mortality and decreased breeding success (Dann et al. 2000; Chiaradia et al. 2010).A newer and additional challenge for this species is in the fast-changing marine and terrestrial environment, particularly in the rapidly warming sea of south-eastern Australia (Ramirez et al. 2017, Voice et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2012), wherein southwestern Australia the warming sea has been associated with poorer breeding (Cannell et al. 2012). Penguins have also been shown to catch less prey under warmer conditions (Carroll et al. 2016). Oceanographic change may lead to a mismatch between plankton and the small pelagic fish that are also penguin prey (Hinder et al. 2013). Increasing terrestrial temperatures in the spring and summer months can cause fatal hyperthermia in both chicks and adults (Cannell et al. 2011, Cannell et al. 2012, Cannell et al. 2016). This issue is particularly relevant in those colonies where nesting occurs within the vegetation rather than in burrows as a result of a soft, sandy substrate. Remarkably, some of these pressures can be locally offset by a wide range of conservation efforts, such as the case of increasing population size at Phillip Island (Sutherland &amp; Dann 2012, 2014), St Kilda (Preston et al. 2010; Preston 2011), Manly (Carlile et al. 2015), Oamaru (Agnew et al. 2016). Sites without active conservation measures have experienced a severe decrease, where many known breeding colonies no longer exist (Dann 1994; Stevenson &amp; Woehler 2007, Wilson &amp; Mattern 2019). Local extinction of many small colonies continues in Australia and New Zealand."

    "threats_description": "The species has suffered historically as a result of poisoning, shooting and the pollution of water by pesticides and other chemicals (David et al. 2021). Agricultural pesticide poisoning caused its extirpation as a breeder in Israel in the 1950s; it has since recolonised (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Carcass poisoning and water pollution continues to drive declines in Europe and parts of Asia. Accumulation of heavy metals in the food chain can have sub-lethal effects (Carneiro et al. 2018). Whilst it is well-suited to the presence of humans, particularly in terms of its diet, the modernisation of cities has been shown to reduce available habitat, with overall Black Kite populations showing declines through the 20th century in Delhi and Istanbul (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (STRIX 2012). Black Kites are also susceptible to electrocution by power lines (e.g. Dixon et al. 2013; Barbazyuk et al. 2021)."

    "threats_description": "In the past, the use of organochlorine pesticides seemed to cause a decline in Europe and probably to a lesser extent also in Africa (Brown et al. 1982, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Currently, the main threat in its breeding range is the conversion of its habitat to agricultural land, an environment in which crop gathering by combine harvesters causes frequent breeding failure in the species through nest destruction by farm machinery and increased risk of predation by native species (del Hoyo et al. 1994; Berger-Geiger et al. 2019). Intensification on this land increases this threat (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001), as does the increasing tendency for earlier harvest dates (Berger-Geiger et al. 2019). It is commensal with some forms of agriculture, and changes in these practices could leave it potentially vulnerable by depleting its supply of small birds and mammals to prey on (del Hoyo et al. 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is also very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012; Schaub et al. 2020). Higher temperatures and aridity caused by climate change are predicted to reduce nesting success in some areas (Berger-Geiger et al. 2019). It is illegally killed in several European countries (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018). In its African wintering grounds, the species is under threat from locust control and droughts in the Sahel (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing and burning (Thiollay 2006). It is also reported to be used for traditional medicine in Benin (Williams et al. 2013). In India, its grassland wintering sites are under threat from grazing, burning, urbanisation and industrialisation, while intensive pesticide use may lead to reduced prey availability and direct mortality (Ganesh &amp; Prashanth 2018)."

    "threats_description": "Croplands have expanded since the late 19th century and complete conversion is now the principal threat (Hagen et al. 2002, Wolfe et al. 2007), as areas with more than 37% cultivated land are probably unsustainable (Hagen et al. 2002). Intensive grazing reduces food and cover, and herbicides reduce shrub cover and acorn production (Wolfe et al. 2007). Market hunting greatly reduced populations in the early 20th century (Wolfe et al. 2007). Conversion of prairies to woodlands from the lack of fire is one of the primary threats facing the species, yet this threat can be reversed through proactive land management that includes the use of prescribed fire at biologically appropriate intervals (Hagen and Elmore 2016). Yet fire could also threaten the species in the short-term at the local level, as 780,000 acres of habitat was destroyed by fire in 2017, and populations in these areas were concurrently impacted (Belinda et al. 2017). However, populations will likely be improved in the future as a result of this (Belinda et al. 2017). Numbers declined more severely in the dust bowl of the late 1930s, and significantly with droughts in the 1950s and early 1990s (Wolfe et al. 2007). Recent droughts have also impacted the species (North American Grouse Partnership in litt. 2018, R. Rodgers in litt. 2018), decreasing chick and juvenile survival (Ross et al. 2018).Today, recreational hunting is limited to Kansas and the conservative seasons produce an annual harvest of fewer than 1,000 birds (Wolfe et al. 2007, Van Pelt et al. 2013). In Oklahoma, 39.5% of the prairie-chicken mortality recorded was due to fence collisions, while in New Mexico, this figure was 26.5%. The species has also been found to avoid power lines, and so it is likely that the erection of other tall structures (including wind turbines) will lead to increased habitat fragmentation and reduced home range sizes (Pruett et al. 2009) as well as reduced reproductive success (Pitman et al. 2005). Wind-energy facilities are increasing in the Great Plains, particularly in states with Lesser Prairie-chickens, as these have the highest potential for wind energy development. If climate change should lead to increased temperatures within the species's range, this could also impact the species as it has been found that nest survival decreases 10% for every half-hour when temperature exceed 34\u00b0C (Grisham et al. 2016)."

Fragmentation of forest also affects the species (Raman and Mudappa 2003).However, declines in density have occurred within protected areas, where there does not appear to have been a significant habitat change, which indicates that further research is required to identify plausible drivers of the decline. Potential threats may come from an undocumented shift in range for a competitor or predator, undetected disease affecting either the individuals of this species or limiting resources, or changed agricultural practice with an as yet undocumented impact on the species."

    "threats_description": "In the mid-20th century the species underwent severe declines in Europe and Israel, driven by poisoning, shooting and trapping for falconry (Kemp 1994). These have subsided, though persecution and the collection of eggs and chicks for falconry still probably constitute the most serious threats to the species. In Italy it is still threatened by illegal shooting (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and in other countries where Skylarks (Alauda arvensis) are hunted (Gustin et al. 2000). In Europe, habitat loss through urbanisation, modification of agricultural practices, construction of roads, open-cast mining, agricultural expansion into steppe and grasslands and afforestation has caused a reduction in hunting areas and prey species. It also suffers from human disturbance, such as rock-climbers, pesticides, electrical powerlines and interspecific competition with Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) (Gustin et al. 2000; Di Vittorio et al. 2017; De Rosa et al. 2019). Local declines in southern Africa have possibly been associated with seed dressings, and whilst the overall effects of pesticides are unknown they have been shown to have negative impacts locally (Kemp 1994, Global Raptor Information Network 2015). In its West African range, the species is vulnerable to habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing and burning as well as exposure to pesticides (Thiollay 2007). It is also vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012)."

It is also threatened by poisoning, both intentionally (pest control) and unintentionally (pesticides used on crops) (Hockey et al. 2005). The species is threatened in Spain and Morocco (the northernmost range extremes) primarily by habitat loss and degradation due to changes in hydrological regime, over-exploitation of catchments and sedimentation (which are altering the periods of wetland flooding), agricultural, industrial and domestic pollution, overgrazing (cattle herds), the burning of reeds, and the introduction of alien species (e.g. Louisiana Swamp Crayfish Procambarus clarkii and Ciprinidae fish which both reduce the availability of food and hence increase competition) (Gomez 2000)."

    "threats_description": "As Black Terns breed in wetlands on floating rafts of plant matter, the reduction of water level due to droughts and water abstraction for domestic and agricultural use represents a significant threat to the species due to loss of breeding habitat. The loss of rafts used for breeding represents a source of lost reproductive success, as shown by increases in breeding populations on the provisioning of artificial rafts (Gochfeld et al. 2018). Drought also has the potential to reduce reproductive success, as lower water levels allow the access of chicks by predators such as pigs. Encroachment of agriculture on wetlands has resulted in further loss and degradation of habitat. Introduction of the peacock bass to Lake Gutan in Panama resulted in the elimination of the Silverside, Meleniris chagresi, a significant prey species of the Black Tern, causing abandonment of this wintering site (Gochfeld et al. 2018)."

    "threats_description": "The species faces similar threats to other African vultures, being susceptible to habitat conversion to agro-pastoral systems, loss of wild ungulates leading to a reduced availability of carrion, hunting for trade, persecution and poisoning (see Botha et al. 2017). In East Africa, the primary issue is poisoning (particularly from the highly toxic pesticide carbofuran), which occurs primarily outside protected areas; the large range sizes of this species and G. rueppellii puts them at significant risk, as this means they inevitably spend considerable time outside protected areas (Ogada and Keesing 2010, Otieno et al. 2010, Kendall and Virani 2012). Hunting with lead ammunition may also be incidentally contributing to species mortality (Naidoo et al. 2017, Garbett et al. 2018). Evidence from wing-tagging and telemetry studies suggests that annual mortality, primarily from incidental poisoning, can be as high as 25% for the species (Kendall and Virani 2012). Cases across Africa suggest that the species may be subject to deliberate and accidental poisoning, respectively (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada et al. 2016b): in the former case for belief-based use and to prevent birds from drawing attention to poaching activities. Mass poisoning events include at least 144 White-backed Vultures killed after feeding on an elephant carcass in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe in 2012 (Groom et al. 2013); 76 died after feeding on 6 poisoned lion carcasses near Ruaha National Park, Tanzania in March 2018 (SSC 2018); 468 died after feeding on 3 elephant carcasses in Botswana in June 2019 (BirdGuides 2019). Modelling has shown that even one poisoned elephant carcass can have a dramatic impact on a population (Murn and Botha 2018). In southern Africa, vultures are caught and consumed for perceived medicinal and psychological benefits (McKean and Botha 2007), and the decline and possible extirpation in Nigeria has been attributed to the trade in vulture parts for traditional juju practices (P. Hall in litt. 2011). The species is recorded in trade in West and Central Africa, with an estimated 924-1,386 individuals traded over a six year period in West Africa, probably representing a significant proportion of the species's regional population (Buij et al. 2016). In South Africa, White-backed Vulture is one of the preferred vulture species in trade, according to a survey of traditional healers and traders (McKean et al. 2013). As a result of this and environmental pressures, it is predicted that the population in Zululand could become locally extinct in 26 years, unless harvest rates have been underestimated, in which case local extinction could be 10-11 years away (McKean and Botha 2007). There is also evidence that it is captured for international trade; for example in 2005, 13 individuals of this species being kept illegally in Italy were reportedly confiscated (F. Genero in litt. 2005).In 2007, diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, and which is fatal to Gyps spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses, was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2008). It was also reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden in litt. 2007) and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International 2008). However, given that livestock carrion is not generally left out for scavenger consumption, this is likely to have less of an impact than it has in south-east Asia (C. Kendall in litt. 2016).Electrocution on powerlines is also a problem in parts of its range, and it is vulnerable to nest harvesting or disturbance by humans (Bamford et al. 2009); perhaps more so than G. rueppellii, as it breeds in trees rather than on inaccessible cliffs (C. Kendall in litt. 2012). Additionally, the wild ungulate populations on which this species relies have declined precipitously throughout West and East Africa, even in protected areas (Western et al. 2009, Botha et al. 2017), and, despite increased livestock numbers, improved animal husbandry and carcass disposal has reduced the number of livestock carcasses available (Mundy et al. 1992). There is also a minor threat from road traffic, with individuals occasionally killed by vehicles (BirdLife Botswana 2008). Reported threats in the Athi-Kaputiei area in Kenya (an important breeding site for the species) include wind energy development, illegal logging of large trees (although Kendall et al. [2017] concluded that tree availability was not a limiting factor for vultures breeding in Masai Mara National Reserve), and natural gas exploration (Shema 2019)."

The Caribbean lowlands are suffering conversion to banana plantations, cattle-ranches and logging, even in the important Indio-Maiz Reserve, Nicaragua (Powell and Bjork 2004). In the north of Costa Rica, 35% of remaining forest was eliminated in 1986-1992 (Powell et al. 1995). A remote sensing study found that forests within the range have been lost at a rate of 8% over three generations (Tracewski et al. 2016; Global Forest Watch 2021). On the Caribbean slope in Panama, even some reserves are threatened by clearance for agriculture (Angehr 2003)."

    "threats_description": "Fire suppression in remaining habitat has been identified as a major continuing threat because it causes scrub to overgrow and pine density to increase, rendering habitat unsuitable. Declines on lands specifically protected for the species are largely the result of reduced habitat quality, caused by disrupted fire regimes (Breininger et al. 1999, 2006, 2009, 2010); suitable Florida Scrub-Jay habitat is thought to have declined by 22% between 1999-2012 (USFWS 2019). In addition, extensive habitat fragmentation has led to a high degree of genetic differentiation (Coulon et al. 2008) and additional land protection to increase connectivity within existing genetic units is likely necessary to prevent further fragmentation and loss of genetic diversity (Coulon et al. 2010, 2012). Reduced immigration into one of the largest remaining populations at Archbold Biological Station has resulted in increased levels of inbreeding and decreased fitness via inbreeding depression, emphasizing the importance of maintaining population connectivity (Chen et al. 2016 ). At Archbold, there is evidence of inbreeding depression at multiple life stages, including hatching failure, juvenile survival, and breeder lifespan (Chen et al. 2016). Housing developments and citrus-groves have replaced much suitable habitat (G. E. Woolfenden in litt. 1998). The rate of development in Florida has increased markedly since the 1960s as the human population almost doubled between 1960 and 1980 (Cox 1987). Direct human disturbance and feral cats affect the increasing number of territories adjacent to housing (Cox 1987), which can have the knock-on impact of reduced nesting success in suburban areas (see Niederhauser and Bowman 2014), and these individuals can also have reduced egg viability too (see Aldredge et al. 2012). Birds in roadside territories are frequently killed by vehicles (Dreschel et al. 1990, Mumme et al. 2000). Several species of snake, bird and mammal are native predators (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996). Nocturnal predators, including yellow rat snakes Elaphe obsoleta, are a particular threat since breeding birds do not appear to be vigilant to, or defend against, nocturnal predators and brooding females are also at risk from being killed (Carter et al. 2007). Hatching failure has been linked to below-average rainfall during the breeding season (Wilcoxen et al. 2011) and so droughts are likely to pose a threat to the species. The recent spread of West Nile virus to Florida may pose a threat to the species (Chu et al. 2003). An observation of nest-predation by invasive fire ants Solenopsis invicta was reported in south-central Florida in 2009 (Wilcoxen and Rensel 2009) and may be a threat to the reproductive success of the species. Climate change may pose a threat to the species through both increased drought and hurricane frequency and intensity, and sea level rise (USFWS 2019)."

    "threats_description": "The main historical threat has been an over-use of surface water for agriculture (Kingsford 2000), but the capacity of the species both to use deeper reservoirs (Murray et al. 2012) and take advantage of inland flooding (Jaensch et al. 2009) means this is probably not having an ongoing influence. The mobility of O. australis means they can seek out refuges such as the Western Treatment Plant at times of drought (Murray et al. 2012, Loyn et al. 2014a). Hunting has also been considered a threat (Loyn 1987) but O. australis are not a legal game species in any Australian jurisdiction and key hunting wetlands are closed if they support significant O. australis concentrations (Menkhorst 2019, Menkhorst et al. 2019). Recreational boating (Stamation et al. 2016) and introduced fish (Stamation and Loyn 2008) may cause local problems for O. australis but are unlikely to cause population declines. In the future, climate change and increasing frequency of drought may impact this species."

    "threats_description": "The disappearance of uncultivated land due to changes in agricultural practice has resulted in the loss of nesting cover and chick food and is directly linked to rapid declines in farmland bird populations in Spain (Traba and Morales 2019). In pastoral areas, pastures have been agriculturally improved and areas of low, herb-rich scrub converted to grassland and further habitat loss has occurred through the loss of arable farming from open hill areas, if livestock are removed (leading to encroachment of tall scrub and forest) (Tucker and Heath 1994). Urbanization and agricultural expansion have also caused habitat fragmentation. Over-hunting is likely to have played a role in the decline of the species: over 60% of estimated potential population may be shot each year (McGowan and Kirwan 2013).The species status as a gamebird of high socioeconomic value means that there is a considerable effort to maintain a huntable surplus, which is eminently achievable with good habitat management: there is some evidence that hunting mortality is compensatory to natural mortality (Soucher et al. 2018). One approach to achieving this has been to release captive-reared birds shortly prior to the hunting season, a practice that increased rapidly from the end of the 20th century (Casas et al. 2016) and upwards of 3-6 million farm-bred partridges are now released annually (D\u00edaz\u2010Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2012). Ensuring hunting bag limits are sustainable is dependent on an accurate assessment of abundance prior to the season, but it was found that in intensive estates where large numbers of birds are released, harvest depended only on release intensity (D\u00edaz\u2010Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2012). The presence of released birds can also increases estimates from field assessments of abundance, but as their survival rate is very low (&lt;0.05 to the next spring: [Souchay et al. 2018]) this adjustment results in larger numbers of 'wild' individuals (birds that have bred) being taken (Casas et al. 2016).The actual stock that is released is also a threat: 63% of farmed birds had mtDNA lineages from Chukar (A. chukar), but more alarmingly so did 45% of wild Red-legged Partridges (Blanco-Aguiar et al. 2008), potentially undermining the genetic distinctiveness of the species. Also illegal importations of A. graeca and A. chukar may also be causing problems through hybridization and competition (Tucker and Heath 1994, McGowan and Kirwan 2013)."

    "threats_description": "The two main threats to the species are direct mortality caused by humans (either accidentally or deliberately) and decreasing availability of food. The main cause of unnatural death is the use of poisoned baits for predator extermination (Anon. 2004b), although shooting and destruction of nests also occurs (Anon. 2004b; N. Batbayar in litt. 2005), and they may accidentally get caught in traps set for other predators (Zhatkanbaev 2011). Shooting and poisoning are increasing in Mongolia (N. Batbayar in litt. 2005), and many birds are trapped or shot in China for their feathers. There are fears that veterinary application of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac, which has caused the near-extinction of several Gyps vultures in India, may have a negative impact on A. monachus (N. Batbayar in litt. 2005; Inskipp et al. 2016), particularly as increasing numbers of the species are wintering in northern India (T. Katzner in litt. 2005). The recent approval for commercialisation of veterinary diclofenac in Spain may have devastating effects on European vultures - in 2020 a Cinereous Vulture was confirmed as the first individual to die from veterinary diclofenac in Europe (BirdLife 2021). A study in central Spain during 2003-2005 found high concentrations of antibiotics in blood samples from 57% of nestlings tested (Lemus et al. 2008). The same study found two antibiotics in the liver samples of all dead nestlings that were tested. It is hypothesised that antibiotic residues, particularly quinolones, cause liver and kidney damage, deplete lymphoid organs and alter bacteria flora, facilitating pathogenic bacterial and fungal infections (Lemus et al. 2008). The anti-inflammatory drug nimesulide, suspected to be highly toxic is also considered to be present widely across Nepal (C. Bowden in litt. 2018). In Europe, decreased food availability was formerly caused by European Union legislation on carcass disposal (Anon. 2004b), however, recently passed regulations will allow the operation of feeding stations for scavengers (A. Brunner in litt. 2010). In eastern Europe and central Asia, particularly in the former Soviet Union, changes in agricultural practices and human migration from the countryside to the cities have greatly reduced numbers of domestic livestock. In Georgia and Armenia, declines may be linked to the loss of subsidies for sheep-herding in the post-Soviet era (M. McGrady in litt. 2007). Additionally, there have been steep declines in many populations of wild ungulates which provide a major food source for the species. The Saiga antelope (Saiga tartarica), for example, numbered over one million individuals ten years ago, and has now been reduced to a population of 30,000-40,000 owing to uncontrolled hunting and severe winters (W. Fremuth in litt. 2005). In South Korea, food limitation is a serious problem such that the species relies on supplementary food (Lee et al. 2006). Habitat loss is also thought to be important (Anon. 2004). For instance, in Portugal, there may be suitable foraging areas, but nesting sites are limited (Louren\u00e7o et al. 2013). The majority of brood losses occur during the incubation period and it is suspected this may be partially due to low and fluctuating temperatures (Batbayar et al. 2006) and so changes in air temperatures resulting from climate change may be a potential future threat to the species. Nest abandonment can also occur as a result of disturbance, for instance cork exploitation (Margalida et al. 2011). Recent studies surrounding the core population of Cinereous Vultures in the Balkans (thought to be genetically distinctive and geographically isolated) also found wind farms to be a potential threat towards the species (Vasilakis et al. 2016). Where operational wind farms existed, collision mortality was thought to affect c. 5-11% of the core population (Vasilakis et al. 2016). Low mitochondrial diversity and demographic bottlenecks were also found in Turkish populations, likely preventing population expansion (\u00c7akmak et al. 2019a, b). The exact effect genetic vulnerability however requires further investigation. Due to proximity to urban areas, electric shocks and collision can further impact migratory birds, especially across the species's migration route to China (Ming 2019)."

It also suffers mortality from collisions with cars, electrocution from powerlines (Mebs and Schmidt 2006) and accidental capture in traps set for fur-bearing mammals (Orta et al. 2015). The species may also suffer reduced reproductive success from fluctuating weather caused by climate change (Pokrovsky et al. 2012). An increase in rainfall caused by climate change may increase the risk of nest collapse (Beardsell et al. 2017). In the past, organochlorine pesticide treatments were thought to pose a threat to the species in the U.S.A. (Henny et al. 1984). Grazing livestock in meadows and marshes may reduce the suitability of these habitats for foraging in overwintering areas (Littlefield et al.1992)."

    "threats_description": "A major threat to the species is forest loss and degradation. Apart from a loss in habitat and nesting sites, the destruction of forests may additionally negatively impact the availability of prey; even though the species is also found in open habitats and shows some tolerance of disturbance it requires substantial patches of forest (del Hoyo et al. 1994, Holste et al. 2020). The main reasons for deforestation within the range are the expansion of agriculture and livestock pastures. Trophy hunting represents an additional threat, though its impact has not been quantified and may be lower than the impacts of habitat loss (Holste et al. 2020)."

J. R. Robertson in litt. 2008), which may be sufficient adult mortality to drive a significant decline. The continued presence of pigs on the main Auckland Island is likely to be impacting breeding success, with chick predation strongly suspected wherever nests are accessible to pigs (Phillips et al. 2016, R. Phillips in litt. 2018). Cats are known to have a negative impact on breeding success on the Kerguelen Islands (ACAP 2009). On Marion Island, house mice Mus musculus are killing up to 5% of chicks annually and this rate is likely to increase unless mice are eradicated (Dilley et al. 2015). Rats have been eradicated from most New Zealand colonies. The population on Heard Island may be at risk from volcanic eruptions, where a large event could impact a large percentage of the colony present. To date, eruptions have not had dramatic impacts (Phillips et al. 2016)."

In addition to clearing of habitat for road building, pollution resulting from road building is also a threat, which happens when sedimentation occurs as a result of poorly constructed roads. Logging and construction practices that increase water temperatures and siltation might have an adverse effect on tailed frog subpopulations (Nussbaum et al. 1983, Welsh and Ollivier 1998). See also Bury and Corn (1988) and Corn and Bury (1989) for information on negative effects of timber harvest. Diller and Wallace (1999) emphasized that current timber harvest practices are not as detrimental as those used in the past. Despite negative effects of logging, this species frequently occurs in many young forests that have been harvested one or more times in the past. Sensitivity to timber harvest might depend on surface geology and harvest practices (Adams and Bury 2002, Welsh and Lind 2002)."

This might increase harvesting effort in the future, but at the moment, such utilisation is not considered to constitute a threat to the species. It is sometimes found in the international pet trade but at levels that do not currently constitute a major threat."

Crnobrnja-Isailovi\u0107 pers. comm. September 2019). More than 4,500 small diversion hydro-power plants are in the planning phase in the Balkan Peninsula (Crnobrnja-Isailovi\u0107 et al. 2021). In 2019, 188 of those hydro-power plants were under construction, while another 1,004 plants were already operating, for which the building began from 2010, and 1,031 (or 37%) of the planned dams were projected to be built in protected areas with high protection status (118 of which were in national parks, 547 in Natura 2000 areas - see in Schwarz and Vienna 2017). Climate change may also be a future problem which will further compound the drying of the river habitats (J. Crnobrnja-Isailovi\u0107 pers. comm. September 2019).In the EU27 region, the number of projected small hydropower plants in 2020 was 598 for Greece and 594 for Bulgaria (Crnobrnja-Isailovi\u0107 et al. 2021)"

    "threats_description": "Timber harvest negatively affects Rhyacotriton salamanders more than any other amphibian in the Oregon Coast Range (Bury and Corn 1988, Corn and Bury 1989), as they are often sensitive to increased temperature and sedimentation. However, the species can persist in habitats after habitat alteration, including logging (USFWS 2000). Some subpopulations are isolated by intervening areas of unsuitable habitat, and are therefore more vulnerable to extirpation through natural processes that are exacerbated by timber harvest. Additionally, a study conducted by Emal and Storfer (2014) showed that this species exhibits limited connectivity among subpopulations, which in addition to adding to the concern of local extirpations from the impacts of logging suggests that this species will also have limited success in tracking shifts in suitable habitat due to climate change.Much of the range has undergone large-scale timber harvesting or is harvestable, and there is concern that adequate protection of habitat is lacking (Federal Register, 29 June 1995), however current timber harvest regulations provide more protection for habitat than did those of the unregulated past (Diller and Wallace 1996). USFWS (2000) concluded that current regulatory practices do not constitute a threat. USFWS (2000) determined that the survival of the species is not currently threatened by logging or other habitat alterations, but noted that the most vulnerable populations are those at the southern and eastern edges of the range.The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, \u201cBsal\u201d) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European fire salamanders since its apparent arrival in 2008 through the international pet trade. Although the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. Within the US, the Pacific coast has been identified as a potentially high risk area for Bsal introduction and spread (Yap et al. 2015, Richgels et al. 2016)."

    "threats_description": "The majority of this species' range falls within the boundaries of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, therefore most of the subpopulations are protected from threats such as timber harvesting and mining. However, the boundaries of the park do not necessarily provide adequate protection from the impacts of climate change. Milanovich et al. (2010) predicted drastic declines by 2080 due to habitat loss as a result of warming temperatures. This species has low dispersal ability and already occurs at high elevations, therefore it is thought to be unlikely to migrate to higher elevations to adapt to a warming climate (NatureServe 2021). The greatest long-term threat to this species is likely the result of acid precipitation, which falls on the high elevation sites occupied by this species in the Great Smoky Mountains and other areas of the southern Appalachians (Green et al. 2014). The highest deposition rates of nitrogen and sulphate in North America occur on the highest peaks of the Great Smoky Mountains (K. Langdon pers. comm. 1997). However, additional evidence to support that this species is negatively impacted by acid precipitation is needed. Disease poses another threat to this species, as Ranavirus has been found in individuals within Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Gray et al. 2009, Sutton et al. 2015). Additionally, the emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, \u201cBsal\u201d) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European fire salamanders since its apparent arrival in 2008 through the international pet trade. Although the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. The eastern USA has the highest diversity of salamanders in the world and should Bsal be introduced in the region it is likely to cause widespread amphibian losses, especially among members of Salamandridae and Plethdontidae, and affects to their broader communities. This part of the country has been identified as a potentially high risk area for Bsal introduction and spread (Martel et al. 2014, Yap et al. 2015, Richgels et al. 2016)."

    "threats_description": "The principal threats include localized general habitat destruction, including the installation of run-of-river small hydropower plants throughout Balkan Peninsula (Crnobrnja-Isailovi\u0107 et al. 2021), unsympathetic forest management, and pollution of breeding sites by agrochemicals, collection for commercial purposes (i.e. the pet trade), introduction of predatory species (salmonids and crayfish (Procambarus clarkii)) and population fragmentation. The mortality of adults on roads is a localized threat in some parts of its range. The presence of chytridiomycosis has been reported in some Spanish subpopulations. Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to B. dendrobatidis (Bd), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world. Both pathogens cause the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, and both are believed to have originated in Asia (for Bsal: Martel et al. 2014, for Bd: O'Hanlonet al. 2018). While Bd can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, Bsal has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel et al. 2013). Bd has spread globally, but at present Bsal is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel et al. 2014, Nguyen et al. 2017). Currently in Europe, Bsal has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g. Thein et al. 2020) and Spain (Martel et al. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel et al. 2014). Bsal is a threat to this species and has caused declines in both wild and captive populations (A. Martel and F. Pasmans pers. comm. September 2019). Based on current distribution data for Bsal, it is expected that the natural advancement of the infection could be between 10\u201320 km per year.. With multiple outbreaks occurring within its range, modelling (see attached Supplementary Information) has found this species to be at extremely significant risk from Bsal in the next 21\u201345 years (which represents three generations). However, this does not take into account further human-induced introduction of the disease, and should new outbreaks occur within this species\u2019 range then it will need to be reassessed as soon as possible."

    "threats_description": "This species is sensitive to increased stream temperature and sedimentation, such as may result from logging or road construction for logging access. Timber harvesting itself has been shown to negatively affect Rhyacotriton salamanders more than other amphibians in the same area (Bury and Corn 1988b, Corn and Bury 1989). Some subpopulations are isolated by intervening areas of unsuitable habitat, and these subpopulations are then vulnerable to extirpation through natural processes that are exacerbated by timber harvest (especially of old growth stands on north-facing slopes). The low vagility and dispersal ability of this species further contributes to the concern of local extirpation.Climate change also poses a potential risk to this species, as Olson and Burton (2019) projected extensive loss of headwater stream lengths across the species' range, as well as potentially dramatic alterations of surface-water habitat conditions and over-ridge connectivity. Volcanism is also a threat, although rare, in this region. This species is thought to be able to survive an eruption if some microhabitat components are maintained, as was demonstrated in the aftermath of the eruption of Mt. St. Helens. The spatial locations and timing of an eruption is thought to play an important role in this species' persistence, as during the blast from Mt. St. Helens the landscape was under snow, which helped to insulate the species (A. McIntyre pers. comm. April 2021). Due to their limited dispersal the re-establishment of the species across the landscape after an eruption would likely be a long-term process. Additional possible concerns include chemical applications, fire, impassable culverts and road construction, human recreational activities, and mining, as these have impacted similar species in the region (Howell and Maggiulli 2011). For example, the 2020 wildfires in western Oregon likely caused widespread habitat loss across this portion of the species' range. However, additional research is needed to determine the impacts, if any, these activities have on this species."

The threat from collection has been reduced somewhat in recent years. Collection without a permit is illegal in Texas and New Mexico. Captive breeding has generated a good supply of animals for the pet trade. Populations away from roads (the majority of the population) presumably are not significantly threatened. Occasional persecution by humans occurs in Mexico because of confusion with the coral snake."

    "threats_description": "In general, torrent salamanders are sensitive to increased temperature and sedimentation, such as may accompany timber harvesting or road construction for logging access. Forest disturbance is a key concern for this species, as its range is highly managed for wood production in the Pacific Northwest (Bury and Corn 1988b, Corn and Bury 1989, Green et al. 2014). However, preliminary data suggest that this species may tolerate habitat alteration better than other species in the genus, and that increases in sedimentation might be less problematic for this species compared to other Rhyacotriton (Hallock and McAllister 2002). A study by Emel et al. (2019) suggests that decreased genetic connectivity and relatively low genetic diversity in this species when compared to Rhyacotriton variegatus may be associated with disturbances that reduce forest cover, with timber harvest being the most pervasive form of disturbance. McIntyre et al. (2018) saw no evidence of declines in torrent salamander densities in timber harvested streams in western Washington in the two years immediately following harvest; however, there was evidence of a decline in some sites in the eight years following harvest (McIntyre et al. 2018).The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, \u201cBsal\u201d) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European fire salamanders since its apparent arrival in 2008 through the international pet trade. Although the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. Within the US, the Pacific coast has been identified as a potentially high risk area for Bsal introduction and spread (Yap et al. 2015, Richgels et al. 2016)."

However, effective hunting controls and high reproductive potential potential render this a low threat (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Thompson and Carroll 2009, Cabot et al. 2019a). Whilst deforestation and the expansion of farmed land is considered to be increasing habitat availability, the intensification of agriculture throughout the region is resulting in the species becoming more scarce throughout its range, and hence presents a serious threat to its persistence in the future (Thompson and Carroll 2009)."

    "threats_description": "The Caribbean region shows evidence of climate warming at regional (Stephenson et al. 2014, IPCC 2018) and local scales (Burrowes et al. 2004, Bhardwaj et al. 2018). The frequency of extreme events like droughts and unreliable rains have increased significantly in the last decade (M\u00e9ndez-L\u00e1zaro et al. 2014, Oppenheimer et al. 2019) and may continue to rise in the future (IPCC 2014, 2018). Due to characteristics intrinsic to their biology and physiology, patterns of recent climate change in the Caribbean are expected to be unfavorable to this species (Puerto Rico Red List Assessment Workshop 2020).Individuals of this species have tested positive for the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), at low prevalence and low infection intensities in the lowlands of El Yunque National Forest and in the San Juan metropolitan area (P. Burrowes unpubl. data.). In northern Puerto Rico, Bd was recorded in 3/9 individuals of this species (T. B\u00e1ez pers. comm. to Neftal\u00ed R\u00edos-L\u00f3pez) and Bd is present at low intensities in the USVI subpopulations (R. Platenberg pers. comm. 2020). At the time of this assessment, chytridiomycosis is not considered a major threat to this species.The passing of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) in 2016 to address Puerto Rico\u2019s economic crisis has created a new level of uncertainty about the future of public protected areas on the island as control over decision making is transferred from local authorities to an unelected board of financial managers (Snow 2017, Castro-Prieto et al. 2019). It is feared that this change might favor economic activities that will facilitate land use changes, driving the destruction and degradation of important habitats, and negatively impacting both biodiversity and human populations across Puerto Rico who depend on healthy and intact ecosystems for survival (Puerto Rico Red List Workshop June 2020).While some studies have shown that Small Indian Mongoose (Urva auropunctata) prey upon native coquis, only a small proportion (~1%) of their stomach contents include amphibians (Wolcott 1953, Pimentel 1955, Viella 1998). The introduced Cuban Tree Frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) is a generalist predator that may include coquis in its diet, however the proportion of amphibians found in stomach content analysis (3.5%) is also low (Glorioso et al. 2010). This information suggests that the relative threat level of introduced predators on this species is low (Puerto Rico Red List Assessment Workshop 2020, R. Platenberg pers. comm. 2020)."

    "threats_description": "The major threats to the species are pollution of streams with agrochemicals, canalization, and water extraction from streams for agricultural purposes, and the loss of terrestrial habitats associated with streams through conversion to forestry plantations (Eucalyptus and Pinus plantations). In Portugal, habitat is at risk from fire. Species distribution modelling projects a loss of &gt;30% of the species potential range in the period 2041\u20132070 (Ara\u00fajo et al. 2011). Climate change could be a serious threat for this species in the following decades due to shifts in available suitable habitat, according to climatic modelling (Cruz et al. 2016).Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to B. dendrobatidis (Bd), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world. Both pathogens cause the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, and both are believed to have originated in Asia (for Bsal: Martel et al. 2014, for Bd: O'Hanlon et al. 2018). While Bd can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, Bsal has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel et al. 2013). Bd has spread globally, but at present Bsal is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel et al. 2014, Nguyen et al. 2017). Currently in Europe, Bsal has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g. Thein et al. 2020) and Spain (Martel et al. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel et al. 2014). Laboratory trials have found this species to be highly susceptible to lethal chytridiomycosis, caused by Bsal (A. Martels and F. Pasmans pers. comm. June 2021, Gilbert et al. 2020). While Bsal has been found in Spain, extinction risk modelling demonstrates that this species will not be at significant risk from the natural spread of the fungus in the next 50 years, with the nearest outbreak occurring 1,308 km away. Based on current distribution data for Bsal, it is expected that the natural advancement of the infection could be up to 10 km per year which would result in a conservative advancement of 400\u2013500 km per 50 years. However, this does not take into account human-induced introduction of the disease, and should a new outbreak occur within or nearer to this species\u2019 range then it will need to be reassessed as soon as possible."

Predators include introduced bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) (Hovey and Bergen 2003), but the level of threat posed by these amphibians is uncertain. In northern Baja California the species is impacted by changes to aquatic systems due to urbanization and agriculture. In southern Baja California, it is being affected by human disturbance, the introduction of alien species, and the impact of dams in its palm oasis habitat."

    "threats_description": "The main threats to this species are loss of woodland habitat (especially as a result of forest fires) and pollution from agricultural and domestic sources. However, it is not believed to be significantly at risk.Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to B. dendrobatidis (Bd), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world. Both pathogens cause the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, and both are believed to have originated in Asia (for Bsal: Martel et al. 2014, for Bd: O'Hanlon et al. 2018). While Bd can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, Bsal has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel et al. 2013). Bd has spread globally, but at present Bsal is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel et al. 2014, Nguyen et al. 2017). Currently in Europe, Bsal has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g. Thein et al. 2020) and Spain (Martel et al. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel et al. 2014). Laboratory trials for susceptibility to Bsal found Salamandra corsica was susceptible to the disease, and mortality would occur if left untreated (F. Pasmans and A. Martel pers. comm. June 2021). There are no current records of Bsal within this species' range, however, it should be monitored if an outbreak occurs. Based on current distribution data for Bsal, it is expected that the natural advancement of the infection could be up to 10 km per year which would result in a conservative advancement of 400\u2013500 km per 50 years. Extinction risk modelling demonstrates that this species would be at significant risk from the natural spread of the fungus in the next 50 years, and could be categorised under Endangered or Vulnerable under criterion E if it was found in mainland Europe. However, this is an island species and Corsica currently has no records of Bsal. This does not take into account human introduction of the disease, and should a new outbreak occur on Corsica then it will need to be reassessed as soon as possible as this may be a future threat."

    "threats_description": "The principal threat to this species is degradation of habitat, since it is a habitat specialist with little tolerance of environmental change (Williams et al. 1981). It breathes primarily (approximately 90%) through the skin (Guimond 1970) and is therefore dependent on cool, well-oxygenated, flowing water. Construction of dams stops swift water flow and submerges riffles. Logging, mining, road construction and maintenance, and other activities, can cause extensive sedimentation that covers the loose rock and gravel important as nest sites, and for shelter and food production. In Illinois, the majority of formerly rocky habitat has been buried under silt (Phillips et al. 1999). Chemical pollutants and acid mine drainage are probably destructive, especially to eggs and larvae. Thermal pollution of water with a consequent oxygen loss would also be detrimental. Several streams in Alabama have been polluted, impounded, or otherwise modified to the extent that they are, from all indications, incapable of supporting hellbender populations (Mount 1975), which has likely contributed to the species' possible disappearance in this state. Injuries and deaths sometimes also result when the salamanders are hooked by anglers, and some fishermen still believe that Hellbenders are dangerously poisonous and also destroy game fish and their eggs (both beliefs are false), and therefore kill them at every opportunity. In the past, there were even attempts by organized sportsmen\u2019s groups in West Virginia to eradicate them. There is some collecting of Hellbenders for sale as live animals or as preserved specimens. Over-collecting has been considered a serious threat in some parts; a decline was noted in the early 1990s, apparently due to collecting. Nickerson and Mays (1973b) noted additional factors they suspected might affect local populations, such as gigging (hunting of the species at night), heavy canoe traffic, dynamiting of large boulders to enhance commercial canoe traffic, and riverside cattle and pig pens. Hellbenders generally are intolerant of heavy recreational use of habitat.Additional threats include habitat modifications as a result of industrialization and urbanization, increased channelization and impoundment of streams that contribute to increased siltation, and pollution of streams from agricultural run-off, mining wastes, and thermal pollution (Green et al. 2014). Disease may also pose a threat to this species, as Bd and Ranavirus have both been detected in this species and many subpopulations have declined for unclear reasons (Bodinof et al. 2011, Souza et al. 2012). Additionally, the emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, \u201cBsal\u201d) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European fire salamanders since its apparent arrival in 2008 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier et al. 2016). Although the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. Should Bsal be introduced to the US, the impacts on salamander populations could be rapid and severe if immediate mitigation action is not taken."

The frequency of extreme events like droughts and unreliable rains have increased significantly in the last decade (M\u00e9ndez-L\u00e1zaro et al. 2014, Oppenheimer et al. 2019) and may continue to rise in the future (IPCC 2014, 2018). While this is an adaptable species and is known to occur in brackish waters, a potential threat to species viability in coastal wetlands is comprised by the predicted rise in sea level and salt water intrusion as a consequence of global warming (Rios-L\u00f3pez 2008). The drying up of water small water bodies (reproduction sites) and diversions of water into cisterns for domestic use represents a less severe, but growing threat in the US Virgin Islands (R. Platenberg pers. comm. 2020).Both adults and juveniles from the highlands of El Yunque National Forest, Carite State Forest and Toro Negro have been found to be infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), but the prevalence and infection intensities were significantly higher in juveniles (P. Caligari and P. Burrowes unpubl. data). No positive samples have been detected from the US Virgin Islands subpopulations as of 2020 (R. Platenberg pers. comm. 2020). The introduced snake species, Xenochrophis vittatus, is a potential threat this frog (A. Puente pers. comm. 2020)."

    "threats_description": "This species experienced rapid population declines in some parts of its range starting in the mid 1980s. At first, the cause(s) of the decline were not known. The amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) was first confirmed in this species in southeast Queensland in 1995 (Berger et al. 1999) and dead frogs that have suffered from chytridiomycosis have been found in southeastern Queensland and northeastern New South Wales. This disease is now suspected as the primary cause of the rapid declines of this species. This water-borne disease thrives in certain temperatures, such that the regions where these ideal temperatures occur have been the hotspots for declines. Elsewhere within the species' range, it has persisted and remains stable because chytridiomycosis is not considered a threat.However, additional threats to this species exist. These include the loss and degradation of habitat through agricultural and urban development including pollution, although this species is tolerant of a degree of modification and can be found in livestock pasture. Other significant threats are the introduced predatory fish Gambusia holbrooki, and the spread of weeds."

Forest fires have also had a damaging effect (particularly in 1997-1998). Although apparently intolerant of disturbance to canopy cover, the large range and high abundance of this species suggests that it is not imminently threatened."

Over 50,000 skins were traded in 1980, most apparently originating in Paraguay, with Japan and USA leading consumers (Folch 1992). Hunting has reportedly contributed to local declines and extinctions (Kirwan et al. 2021).In recent years, the large-scale conversion of central South American grasslands for agriculture and cattle-ranching has considerably reduced and fragmented its available habitat, particularly in the pampas and cerrado strongholds; this is causing declines and increasing isolation of the remaining population (da Silva 1995, Bazzano et al. 2014, Kirwan et al. 2021)."

Research has since shown that the declines were caused by chytridiomycosis, an infection caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) (NSW OEH 2012). Subpopulations of this subspecies can carry high infection rates (greater than 80%) of the chytrid fungus (Hunter et al. 2009), although there can be significant seasonal variation in infection rates and impact of the disease (Kinney et al. 2011). In the summer of 2019-2020, catastrophic bushfires impacted many regions in eastern Australia including coastal and inland regions of New South Wales and eastern Victoria. The habitat of both subspecies would have been impacted in some parts of their range by these bushfires. The scale and intensity of bushfires is predicted to increase as a result of climate change impacting rainfall and increasing the duration and intensity of droughts (CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology 2020) and is an emerging threat for many species in this region."

Recent declines in north-western Europe might also be related to the effects of climate change, but there is no further information at this time. In T\u00fcrkiye, it is threatened by urban development and agricultural development. Within the former Soviet Union, destruction of wetlands is also the most serious threat, although industrial pollution and recreational activities also impact certain subpopulations. Additional localized threats to this species include mortality along roads, entrapment in open wells with vertical walls, hybridization and replacement by Bombina variegata and collection for the pet trade. However, at a global scale this species is not significantly threatened.Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been recorded in this species, but no negative effects or mass mortalities have been observed to date (Europe Red List Assessment Workshop September 2019)."

Destruction and degradation of breeding sites through draining and filling are causing habitat fragmentation. Many of these sites have become isolated, and could eventually result in deleterious levels of inbreeding and reduced chances of re-establishment for locally extirpated subpopulations. Thousands of local subpopulations have already disappeared due to habitat loss associated with intensive human uses such as agriculture, wood plantations, industry, urban and linear infrastructures development, and a larger number is expected will become lost in the future (Petranka 1998). Despite being found in the international pet trade, current levels do not constitute a major threat to the species."

Borz\u00e9e pers. comm. 2019, Lee et al. 2011). In the Republic of Korea this species is subject to localized impacts from road mortality, exhibiting the highest rate of road kill among snake species across six national parks (Kim et al. 2018).

    "threats_description": "Threats to local sub-populations include intensive timber harvesting practices that reduce canopy closure, understorey vegetation, uncompacted forest litter, or coarse woody debris (moderately to well-decayed) in areas surrounding breeding sites (deMaynadier and Hunter 1999). Negative impacts of intensive timber harvesting extend at least 25\u201335 m into uncut forest (deMaynadier and Hunter 1998). Many subpopulations are becoming increasingly isolated as deforestation and loss of vernal pools reduce gene flow among demes (Petranka 1998). This might result in inbreeding depression and reduce the probability of re-establishment of extirpated sub-populations. Local subpopulations might be heavily impacted by excessive mortality of adults caused by vehicles on roads near breeding sites. Roads negatively impact salamander abundance in roadside habitat and might serve as partial barriers to movement (deMaynadier and Hunter 2000). Embryo mortality generally decreases as pH deceases below 6.0, though in some areas successful reproduction has occurred at a relatively low pH (Cook 1983, Blem and Blem 1989). In central Pennsylvania, low pH was associated with deleterious sub lethal effects on larvae (Sadinski and Dunson 1992). High concentrations of various chemical elements, unfavourable temperatures, or low oxygen content might result in reproductive failure; see Blem and Blem (1991) and Albers and Prouty (1987). De-icing salts that contaminate roadside vernal pools result in reduced embryonic survival (Turtle 2000)."

Although this species is adapted to disturbed environments, since it lays eggs in anthropic environments, such as urban and cultivated areas (Ponssa and Barrionuevo 2008), this could represent a potential threat due to exposure to chemical pollutants and industrial products (R. Medina pers. comm. December 2017). Recent research (P\u00e9rez-Iglesias et al. 2020) reports sublethal biochemical effects in tadpoles of L. latinasus that were exposed to an imazethapyr (IMZT)-based commercial herbicide formulation."

    "threats_description": "The major threat to this species is deforestation. In Java, habitat loss is mainly due to small-scale agriculture, coffee and tea plantations, and urban development (M. Kusrini pers. comm. September 2009). In Sumatra, deforestation within its range is primarily due to coffee plantations (Indonesia Red List Assessment Workshop May 2017). The species has tested positive for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, although there are currently no records of chytrid-related population declines for this species (Kusrini et al. 2008). It is also found in the international pet trade."

In Bolivia and parts of Brazil, since 2015, an increase in the frequency and intensity of human-induced fires primarily for the purpose of improving and expanding pasture land for cattle has been identified as a threat. In Bolivia, habitat loss due to pastureland expansion (incentivised through legislation), agriculture and human settlement expansion of the cattle grazing (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop September 2019). In Venezuela, this species is locally threatened by habitat alteration due to gold mining (legal and illegal) in Sierra de Imataca, and activity that involves soil removal, river flow deflection, and solid waste accumulation, including mercury that, joint with the deforestation, has favoured huge contamination, erosion and desertification in the area."

Many local subpopulations have been lost, as native forests with seasonal pools have been converted to agricultural and urban uses. In Louisiana, a clear-cut near a breeding pond apparently affected the salamander subpopulation by lowering the survival of adults immigrating from the clear-cut side of the pond, and displacing adults to a less suitable terrestrial habitat (Raymond and Hardy 1991). Despite being found in the international pet trade, current levels do not constitute a major threat to the species."

    "threats_description": "Threats and declines appear to be greatest in the northern or peripheral parts of the range where habitat alteration has negatively affected crayfish populations (Gibbons and Dorcas 2004). Ernst and Ernst (2003) stated that water pollution and acid rain have combined to reduce crayfish populations in many parts of the eastern portion of the snake's range, and that this, along with drainage of wetlands, has eliminated the Queen Snake from many areas where it was once common. In Arkansas, eutrophication due to livestock or poultry waste runoff into streams is a possible threat, as is \"overuse of water resources by human recreational activities\" (Trauth et al. 2004). In the Great Lakes region, siltation from urban or agricultural runoff may reduce or eliminate crayfish populations (Harding 1997). Threats in Illinois include pollution that reduces crayfish populations and siltation of rocky stream bottoms (Phillips et al. 1999). Anecdotal evidence suggests that local populations in the northeastern United States are being reduced in numbers or extirpated as a result of adverse effects of stream degradation and pollution on crayfish (Mitchell 1994, Hulse et al. 2001, White and White 2002). Other potential threats include stream channelization and large impoundments (Mitchell 1994)."

    "threats_description": "There are generally no threats to the Italian subpopulations of Salamandra atra atra. Some local subpopulations in Switzerland are threatened by road mortality and subpopulations of the Dinaric Alps are threatened by localized habitat destruction through intensification of farming methods, tourism (skiing) and infrastructure development. The subspecies S. a. aurorae is threatened by collection for scientific purposes and the pet trade and general habitat alteration through excessive water abstraction from streams, and the removal of ground cover during forestry practices. Subpopulations in Serbia-Montenegro are small, fragmented and threatened by over-collecting for the pet trade and possibly climatic changes.Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to B. dendrobatidis (Bd), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world. Both pathogens cause the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, and both are believed to have originated in Asia (for Bsal: Martel et al. 2014, for Bd: O'Hanlon et al. 2018). While Bd can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, Bsal has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel et al. 2013). Bd has spread globally, but at present Bsal is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel et al. 2014, Nguyen et al. 2017). Currently in Europe, Bsal has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g. Thein et al. 2020) and Spain (Martel et al. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel et al. 2014). Mortality in captivity has been observed due to the Bsal (F. Pasmans and A. Martel pers. comm. June 2021). Along with declines observed in congener S. salamandra, it can be considered to be a threat to this species."

The species' broad use of habitats is suggested as the reason it appears to not be susceptible to chytridiomycosis (Parris 2002). This species instead appears to be a disease reservoir and overwintering tadpoles carry Bd from one season to the next (Narayan et al. 2014)."

Chytrid fungus was detected in this species in Berlin, Germany - however the extent to which this is a threat is unknown. Predation of spawn by waterfowl is an additional threat. Prolonged drought, the effects of which are being exacerbated by climate change, is a problem for this species and its habitats (Europe Red List Assessment Workshop September 2019)."

    "threats_description": "This species is threatened by intensive, short-rotation logging practices that result in increasing scarcity of coarse woody debris on the forest floor and a reduction in moisture content (Corn and Bury 1991, Green et al. 2014). These salamanders may thrive initially after logging but then decline as stumps and logs decay and critical microhabitats are eliminated (Petranka 1998). Across its range, the amount of late successional and old growth forest on which this species relies has been relatively stable on National Forest Service land, while timber harvest continues to degrade these areas on private land (Moeur et al. 2011, Davis et al. 2013, Evelyn and Sweet 2018). Wildfires are the primary cause of habitat loss on National Forest Service land, and these have been increasing in frequency over the last few decades (CDW 2010, Moeur et al. 2011, Davis et al. 2013, Evelyn and Sweet 2018). Climate change may also present a threat to this species, as it will likely exacerbate the impacts of fire on the landscape as well as result in hotter temperatures along forest edges and in clear cuts, and less predictable hydroperiods (Case et al. 2014, Evelyn and Sweet 2018).The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, \u201cBsal\u201d) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European fire salamanders since its apparent arrival in 2008 through the international pet trade. Although the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. Within the US, the Pacific coast has been identified as a potentially high risk area for Bsal introduction and spread (Yap et al. 2015, Richgels et al. 2016). Members of the families Plethodontidae and Salamandridae are particularly susceptible to Bsal (Martel et al. 2014)."

Roads negatively impact salamander abundance in roadside habitat and might serve as partial barriers to movement (deMaynadier and Hunter 2000).

However, none of these factors pose serious threats to the global population, and the species can adapt to certain modified habitats."

    "threats_description": "The species is sensitive to changes in water quality. Correspondingly, industrial pollution of water, destruction and drainage of ponds seem to be the most harmful factors for Triturus cristatus. The impact of natural factors such as ponds overgrowing, shallowing and eutrophication is harmful to urban populations and those near to the range margins. Introduced predatory fishes are leading to declines in some areas. In some parts of the range (of the former Soviet Union) there is substantial commercial collecting of this species for the pet trade. Habitat fragmentation is a threat.Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to B. dendrobatidis (Bd), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world. Both pathogens cause the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, and both are believed to have originated in Asia (for Bsal: Martel et al. 2014, for Bd: O'Hanlon et al. 2018). While Bd can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, Bsal has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel et al. 2013). Bd has spread globally, but at present Bsal is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel et al. 2014, Nguyen et al. 2017). Currently in Europe, Bsal has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g. Thein et al. 2020) and Spain (Martel et al. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel et al. 2014). Laboratory trials for susceptibility to Bsal demonstrate susceptibility to the disease for this species; 100% mortality was observed in all individuals tested (F. Pasmans and A. Martel pers. comm. June 2021). It is unlikely that wild subpopulations would have much resistance to Bsal, which has been reinforced with records of dead individuals recorded in Eifel, Germany that tested positive in 2018 (L\u00f6tters et al. 2020). Thus it is considered to be a major threat to this species which should be monitored. Based on current distribution data for Bsal, it is expected that the natural advancement of the infection could be up to 10 km per year which would result in a conservative advancement of 400\u2013500 km per 50 years. Given its wide range, extinction risk modelling demonstrates that this species will not be at significant global extinction risk from the natural spread of the fungus in the next 50 years. However on a national level there will be subpopulations of greater concern and, with the increased risk of human-induced introduction of the disease, should new outbreaks occur within this species\u2019 range then it will need to be reassessed as soon as possible."

Many subpopulations are vulnerable because of their fragmented nature, and through overgrowth of the species' preferred open habitats (for instance, in abandoned traditional farmland). Populations from the southern Iberian Peninsula (Sierra Nevada) could be threatened by climate change and displacement by more competitive Mediterranean species (J. M Pleguezuelos pers. comm. October 2008). Intrinsic threats for southern populations include poor recruitment capacity, extremely low density, isolation of populations, and global climate warming (for mountain populations) (J. M Pleguezuelos pers. comm. October 2008). While it is not collected, the species is sometimes persecuted through confusion with vipers."

    "threats_description": "Locally, subpopulations have been reduced or eliminated as a result of habitat degradation or loss caused by conversion of habitat to human uses and to a much lesser degree by large-scale commercial exploitation (Jennings and Hayes 1994, Green et al. 2014). Increased stream sedimentation resulting from erosion caused by human activities and wildfires (Gamradt and Kats 1997, Kerby and Kats 1998, Green et al. 2014) has also degraded breeding habitat in some areas (Jennings and Hayes 1994). Many individuals are killed on roads as they move between uplands and aquatic breeding sites (Green et al. 2014). The southern subpopulations are thought to be under greater threat than the northern subpopulations (L. Kats and G. Bucciarelli pers. comm. October 2020).A major threat to this species is the introduced crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and mosquitofish (Gambusia sp.) that prey on adults as well as eggs and larvae. In some areas, this has excluded this species entirely from its historic breeding sites, causing declines and in some areas local extirpations (Green et al. 2014). Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), a fungal pathogen that causes chytridiomycosis in salamanders, is also thought to pose a threat to this species if introduced. A susceptibility trial demonstrated that Bsal is 100% lethal for species in the family Salamandridae, which includes this species (Martel et al. 2014, Longo et al. 2019). While Bsal has not yet been detected in the USA, if exposed the effects on this species could be lethal."

Ambient ultraviolet radiation causes increased mortality of eggs, compared to UV-B-shielded eggs (Blaustein et al. 1995), but natural oviposition sites often might not be subject to damaging levels of UV. Experimental data indicate that larvae are negatively impacted by the presence of trout (Tyler et al. 1998), yet salamanders and trout coexist in some areas (Leonard et al. 1993). The spread of invasive bullfrogs and predatory fishes introduced to lakes used by Ambystoma gracile for sport fishing are more recent threats."

    "threats_description": "Sub-populations in western Utah are limited by scarce habitat (springs) and are potentially threatened by habitat degradation from cattle grazing and agricultural activities. Oil and gas exploration is a increasing threat. Water development could lower water tables and adversely impact spring habitats. Introduced bullfrogs and fishes might have an adverse impact, but the current degree of threat is unknown. Mosquito control agents pose a potential threat. Wasatch Front sub-population is facing serious threats from habitat loss and modification, especially water development associated with the Central Utah Project; current and imminent threats include the Provo River Restoration Project and Wasatch County Efficiency Project; wetlands created as mitigation for the Central Utah Project have contributed only minimally to spotted frog reproduction. Additional threats include continued development along the Wasatch Front, water diversions for irrigation, cattle grazing, timber harvesting, and construction of roads and trails. A recent conservation agreement among the state of Utah and other agencies has significantly reduced the level of threat to the Wasatch Front and West Desert subpopulations (USFWS 1998). The Great Basin sub-population has been adversely affected by habitat degradation resulting from mining, livestock grazing, road construction, agriculture, and direct predation by bullfrogs and non-native fishes. Not likely to be at risk from present acidification inputs in the Rocky Mountains (Corn and Vertucci 1992). Possibly global climate changes are a factor (Hayes and Jennings 1986). At the embryonic stage, UV-B radiation currently does not seem to be contributing to population declines (Blaustein et al. 1999)."

Since it is dependent on riverine vegetation for shelter, the loss of this habitat may result in some localised declines where habitat loss is taking place (Baker and Ray 2013). The effects of water pollution on local availability of food resources and therefore Marsh Mongoose populations is unknown and would warrant investigation. The drainage of swamplands for conversion to arable land has been identified as a threat to this species in eastern Africa (Andama 2000)."

However, African Civets are commonly found for sale as bushmeat, for example in Gabon (Bahaa-el-din et al. 2013) as well as in SE Nigeria, where they are used for both food and skin (Angelici et al. 1999). They are frequently found trapped for meat in other countries, including Sierra Leone, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, DR Congo and Central African Republic (Ray 2013). The majority of animals (generally males, because of their higher civet musk production) kept for the trade of civetone are taken from the wild, and such off-takes are likely to have localised impacts on wild populations, as well as potentially to lead to a severely female-biased sex ratio. In addition, several African Civets have been reported to die within the first three weeks of capture because of severe stress and physical assault during capture and transportation (Pugh 1998). There are also some concerns about the welfare of these animals, which are typically maintained in very small cages in order to facilitate handling during musk extraction from the perineal glands."

    "threats_description": "The species is declining throughout its range due to excessive hunting and wetland conversion for agriculture, tree plantations, and dams. In Brazil and Argentina, hydroelectric projects have eliminated floodplain habitat along many large rivers, including the Tiete, Paran\u00e1, and Rio Grande (DSG 1991), and cattle ranching has severely reduced and fragmented habitats. Competition with domestic livestock may be a major threat (Schaller and Vasconcelos 1978) and pollution of waterways associated with gold mining is a serious threat in the Pantanal. Accidental introduction of bovine diseases may account for large losses reported in Bolivia during the 1970s when reproductive failure was reportedly common (Mann and Schuerholz 1977). Beccaceci (1994) also mentioned disease, hunting, and competition with livestock as possible limiting factors in the Ibera Natural Reserve, Argentina. In the Paran\u00e1 River Delta, the conversion of marshes for exotic tree plantation and hunting threaten the population in Argentina (Varela 2003). In Brazil, tick infestation was one of the most important causes of death after habitat loss in the Parana River basin (Szabo et al. 2003)."

    "threats_description": "The major threat to Serval is wetland habitat loss and degradation (Thiel 2011). Wetlands harbour comparatively high rodent densities compared with other habitat types, and form the core areas of Serval home ranges. Of secondary importance is degradation of grasslands through annual burning followed by over-grazing by domestic livestock, leading to reduced abundance of small mammals (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray et al. 2005).International legal commercial trade is generally declining (Nowell and Jackson 1996), although skins are still traded in large quantities in some countries, such as Senegal, Gambia and Benin (Burnham and Di Silvestre in Hunter and Bowland 2013), and exported to North Africa (K. de Smet and F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2007). Serval pelts seen in trade in Morocco could come from elsewhere, or could indicate the species continued existence in that country (Arce and Prunier 2006). In Zambia pelts are rarely used for traditional clothing, often it is used as substitute for Leopard skins (C. Thiel pers. comm.) Trade in West Africa appears to be primarily for ceremonial or medicinal purposes. For example, they are highly valued for traditional medicine in Nigeria, where, among markets surveyed in five south-west Nigerian towns in 1994, Servals were the second most commonly offered mammalian species (Sodeinde and Soewu 1999 in Hunter and Bowland 2013). Gadsby (1991) proved the occurrence of Serval in Nigeria based on furs of this species being commonly traded on local markets. Trade evidence is used by Maisels et al. (2001) for occurrence in Cameroon and by Sayer and Green (1984) for occurrence in Benin.Although Serval very rarely prey upon livestock (and indeed may even be beneficial to crop farmers due to their predilection for rodents), in rural areas throughout Africa, they are sometimes persecuted for taking poultry and indiscriminate predator control methods practised by pastoralists frequently kill them (L. Hunter and J. Bowland pers. comms.).Sometimes other predators, such as leopards, hyaenas or lions, kill young and even adult Serval (Thiel 2011)."

    "threats_description": "No major threats to this species have been identified in the Cape. The threats associated with loss in habitat quantity and quality due to the development of timber plantations and afforestation in the midlands and montane grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga have been stabilized (no further plantations planned), and are no longer regarded as major dangers to this species. However, afforestation makes the soils on which this species depends less suitable (Armstrong et al. 1998), and has thus effectively reduced area of occupancy. The isolated subpopulations in Mpumalanga may face increasing threats of habitat loss and degradation as a result of mining, agriculture, and human settlements where 77% of the grassland patches are &lt;10 km\u00b2 in size (Neke and du Plessis 2004). The KwaZulu-Natal subpopulation is very rarely seen in gardens, which suggests it will not adapt to human-modified landscapes. This species faces an additional threat of predation by dogs in urban and some rural areas as well as persecution by farmers and home owners who view this species as a pest, particularly within small scale vegetable gardens. Overall, ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation from agricultural, human settlement and industrial expansion, combined alien vegetation infestation and incorrect fire regimes may be causing a decline into the two subpopulations.Overall, there was a 20.4% loss of natural habitat from 1994 to 2011, with an average loss of 1.2% per annum, due primarily to agriculture (5.2% increase; 4,962 km\u00b2), but also plantations, built environments and settlements, mines and dams (Jewitt et al. 2015). There has been no analysis of rate of loss within Mpumalanga Province but the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) mapped all development applications received at a cadastral scale over a 14-year period (2000-2014), which showed that greatest pressure for land-use change has come from prospecting applications (54% of the land surface area) and mining (25% of land surface area), with the balance of applications related to built infrastructure (9%), residential development (4%) and cultivation (0.7%) (L\u00f6tter et al. 2014). Future developments at the above rates or even higher are likely to cause further detriment towards natural ecosystems and processes that this species is associated with. Finally, climate change could directly affect the food resources and impact distribution in the areas bordering semi-arid areas (Hulme et al. 2001, Midgley et al. 2002).However, it should be noted that anthropogenic disturbances do not necessarily cause population declines or a loss of habitat as grazing and the planting of lawns creates suitable habitat and they are found in such landscapes across the distribution. Apparent range contractions in certain (broad) areas of KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga may constitute natural fragmentation as a result of the life-history of the animal being sessile and subterranean, along with its specialised habitat type, and may have become occurred historically before human influence."

    "threats_description": "A range of threats have been identified for P. conspicillatus. Key threats (also see table below) include habitat loss, exploitation, harassment at roosts, electrocution, shooting in orchards, and tick paralysis (Westcott et al. 2001, DERM 2010, Dennis 2012, Woinarski et al. 2014).Decline of P. conspicillatus in Australia has been associated with habitat loss, and persecution such as electrocution and shooting at orchards (Garnett et al. 1999, DERM 2010). The impact of lethal crop protection is believed to have decreased in recent years with prohibition of high voltage electricity grids and with the wide-spread adoption of canopy netting on orchards. However, permits to shoot flying-foxes for commercial crop protection were re-instated by the Queensland government in 2012 after a four-year ban. Rates of clearing of rainforest in the coastal and upland areas in the majority of the Wet Tropics Bioregion have been reduced and are no longer significant (Queensland Herbarium 2014, D. Westcott pers. comm.). However, there has been an intensification of agriculture on the dry western margins of the range and an increase in clearing of sclerophyll vegetation types important for the species in these areas (Queensland Herbarium 2014, D. Westcott pers. comm). Habitat loss for human development impacts coastal areas and plateaus. Recent escalation in rates of transition of sclerophyll vegetation types to closed rainforest has been documented and attributed to changed fire management regimes (Stanton et al. 2014).Conflict between humans and P. conspicillatus in built up areas appears to be growing as the proportion of the population using roosts in urban areas increases (Tait et al. 2014). Methods for ameliorating conflict typically include modification or removal of roosting vegetation and the use of noise and other disturbances to disperse animals away from human occupied areas. The long-term impact of dispersals on P. conspicillatus is unknown. However, conflict at roosts hinders conservation measures.More recently, tick paralysis has been identified as an increasing threat to the species (Fox et al. 2008, Fox 2011, Buettner et al. 2013). Buettner et al. (2013) found that mortality varied between years, with more adult females affected than males.Pteropus conspicillatus are also threatened by mortality from entanglement in backyard drape netting, collision and entanglement in barbed-wire fences, electrocution on power lines, cleft palate and other birth deformities (Richards et al. 2008, Shilton et al. 2008, DERM 2010, J. Maclean pers. comm.).The impact of climate change is unclear but is likely to increase the severity of cyclones and other extreme weather (i.e., heat events) that can kill large numbers and impact the feeding and roosting habitat of the species (DERM 2010). The recent invasion of myrtle rust and tramp ants (electric and yellow crazy ants) into the Wet Tropics region is also a concern for the future status of Wet Tropics species (Metcalfe et al. 2014). In PNG and Indonesia, the range of P. conspicillatus is typically confined to coastal lowlands and islands. These areas are most densely populated by people and subject to the most rapid land use change as documented by remote sensing (Hansen et al. 2013, Stibig et al. 2014). Increasing rates of habitat loss or modification through residential expansion and the clearing of large tracts of forests for expanding oil palm production continue to be a major threat to the species (T. Leary pers. comm.). Logging operations are also expanding in the range of P. conspicillatus, particularly in the West Papua province of Indonesia and the Madang and Morobe provinces of PNG (Stibig et al. 2014). Hunting is another significant threat as flying-foxes are an important food source for many communities and sold as food at local markets (Mack and West 2005, S. Hamilton and T. Leary pers. comm., B. Roberts pers. obs). In both Madang and Lae, P. conspicillatus are hunted and disturbed on an almost daily basis (T. Leary pers. comm, B. Roberts pers. obs.). The impacts of these threats combined with the species\u2019s low reproductive output (Fox et al. 2008) and the population\u2019s low estimated average exponential rate of increase (Westcott et al. 2018) highlight the likelihood of continual decline into the projected future."

    "threats_description": "Poaching triggered by international illegal market demands of Vicu\u00f1a fibre continues to be the major threat to the species. According to the Technical Meeting of the Vicu\u00f1a Convention (2015) there has been, with the exception of Ecuador, an alarming increase in Vicu\u00f1a poaching throughout its range, especially affecting isolated Chilean and relict populations whose marginal distribution increases their vulnerability. Among the factors that facilitate poaching of Vicu\u00f1as in the high Andes are (SACSG, 2014): 1) The wide geographic range of Vicu\u00f1a populations and the extensive long frontier areas among the countries involved; 2) The geographic characteristics of the area, with low Vicu\u00f1a population densities and a high degree of isolation; 3) Lack of human and technical resources devoted to protection of the species in the host countries; 4) High value of the fibre and Vicu\u00f1a products in the international market; 5) Existence of a substantial market for illegal fibre and handcrafts at the local level; 6) Lack of effective punishment for illegal hunters; 7) Insufficient confiscation of illegal products; 8) Limited coordinated security forces within and between countries; 9) Limited benefits to local communities, and sometimes insufficient support and incentives to develop legal Vicu\u00f1a use, resulting in greater benefits from illegal than from legal uses. Thus, it is considered of particular relevance that the following measures to be promoted:A) On cooperation among Andean countries:1. Intensification of inter-boundary cooperation among neighbouring countries, including security forces, for the control of international frontiers to optimize efforts to eliminate illegal traffic.2. Critical revision of the compliance with previous agreements and documents, developed during Technical Meetings of the Vicu\u00f1a Convention on Vicu\u00f1a poaching and trafficking.3. Standardized registry in the five countries of legally obtained fibre, its processing, imports and exports, in order to be able to monitor its commercialization.B) At the national level:1. Information dissemination regarding legal sanctions and the updating of national, regional, and local laws to make them more effective against poaching and illegal commercialization of Vicu\u00f1a fibre and products.2. Facilitation and support of local Andean communities in the development of technical and organizational capacities to harvest fibre from their Vicu\u00f1as under strict animal welfare protocols and strengthening local community organizations.3. Governmental support to local Andean communities in the commercialization and value-added processes of legal fibre, simplifying the process and strengthening the stages of the legal chain of commercialization.4. Supply of sufficient legal fibre for local artisan use at subsidized prices, to minimize use of illegal fibre and increasing value added processes in the countries of origin.5. Reinforcing and implementation at the national level of schemes of supervision, legal oversight, and tracing origins of the fibre, from shearing to its conclusion on the supply chain (shearing, storage, transformation, commercialization, and export).6. Permanent training of police, judicial and customs authorities, with respect to legislation and other subjects related to production and movement of fibre, as well as identification of camelid fibres and their sub-products.7. The intensification of seizures of illegal clothing and the implementation of sanctions to those involved in purchasing or selling them.8. Implementation of informative and awareness campaigns, especially at touristic sites and airports, alerting tourists of the requirements to be met by legal Vicu\u00f1a fibre products.C) On the cooperation between exporting and importing countries:1. Strengthening of local cooperation networks and swifter communication between CITES authorities and importing and exporting countries.2. Development and collaboration in the implementation of systems to trace the origin of Vicu\u00f1a products and sub-products, to be implemented internationally.3. The strengthening of controls in the importing countries regarding the processing and marketing Vicu\u00f1a products and sub-products.Despite the fact that participating countries are moving forward in the development of National Management and Conservation plans since the last Vicu\u00f1a assessment (2008), as well as the provision of guidelines for sustainable management and animal welfare criteria, the lack of specific budgets or poor funding hinder achievement of conservation and management actions. Recent studies have shown that capture, handling, live-shearing and releasing wild Vicu\u00f1as under strict sustainable management and welfare protocols (although showing subtle and transitory behavioural and social structure changes after being released) does not compromise the conservation or maintenance of ecologically functional wild populations (Sahley et al. 2007, Arzamendia and Vil\u00e1 2012, Marcoppido et al. 2017). Among the two widely used methods for capturing Vicu\u00f1as, the traditional \u2018Chaku\u2019 (surround-capture by people on foot) results in less stress on animals than the use of motor vehicles to chase the animals (Sarno et al. 2009, Arzamendia et al. 2010). On the other hand, captive management has proven to have no contribution to Vicu\u00f1a conservation (Lichtenstein 2006). Vicu\u00f1as, domestic camelids and introduced livestock have similar foraging preferences and share Andean habitats. As a result, local people perceive Vicu\u00f1as as a competitive species, and do not tolerate their presence (Lichtenstein and Renaudeau d'Arc 2004). This is especially worrisome around wetland (bofedales) habitats which are critical for Vicu\u00f1as (Koford 1957, Renaudeau d'Arc et al. 2000, Mosca Torres and Puig 2012, Mosca Torres et al. 2015) and locally shared with domestic animals (Borgnia et al. 2008, Wurstten et al. 2014, Arzamendia and Vil\u00e1 2015, McLaren et al. 2018). Vicu\u00f1as are frequently displaced by livestock, from the high-quality habitats to sub-optimal low-productivity habitats (Borgnia et al. 2008), where they still are able to persist. Further, the presence of herders with dogs represents an important stress factor for Vicu\u00f1as (Arzamendia and Vil\u00e1 2015). Habitat loss triggered by livestock over-grazing, and habitat fragmentation due to industrial and rural sprawl, and the development of large-scale mining projects may jeopardize the viability of Vicu\u00f1a populations located beyond protected areas. Mining activities directly impact Vicu\u00f1a populations by occupying preferred habitats and as a result of road kills due to high traffic levels, heavy machinery employed etc., and indirectly through the extraction and pollution of water resources (Mata et al. 2016).Climate change will probably have a detrimental impact in the fragile ecosystems where Vicu\u00f1as occur since they are at the limits of habitable environments. Therefore, the assessment of the potential effects of climate change on Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s habitats is a priority.Epidemiological studies on Vicu\u00f1a wild populations in Bolivia, Per\u00fa and Argentina that share spatial and forage resources with domestic camelids and livestock do not show prevalence levels of endo- or ectoparasites that seem to be a problem for the viability of their populations (Ch\u00e1vez-Vel\u00e1squez et al. 2005, Beltr\u00e1n-Saavedra et al. 2011, Arzamendia et al. 2012, Marcoppido et al. 2016). However, a growing concern is emerging since some Vicu\u00f1a populations throughout their distribution are suffering from mange caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. For example, two important protected areas for the species\u2019 conservation are showing a high incidence of mange: San Guillermo National Park (San Juan, Argentina), created to preserve the two South American wild camelids in Argentina, and Pampa Galeras B\u00e1rbara D\u2019Achille National Reserve (Ayachuco, Per\u00fa), the latter which symbolized the recovery of the species from the brick of extinction in the 60s of the past century. In San Guillermo the problem probably has to do with the introduction of domestic camelids without sanitary controls or quarantine, while in the case of other populations it is due to mismanagement practices related to the capture and shearing of animals, including incomplete preventive veterinary treatments, management without welfare, and overcrowding of animals creating stress. This situation also causes huge economic losses to the local communities because of the drop of Vicu\u00f1a fibre price. A potential threat both in the Andes and worldwide, is the breeding of paco-Vicu\u00f1a (an alpaca/Vicu\u00f1a hybrid) mainly promoted in developed countries out of the Vicu\u00f1a distribution range for commercial purposes. The alpaca was domesticated from the Vicu\u00f1a approximately 6-7,000 years ago (Wheeler 2012). During domestication and subsequent selective breeding, the genome was modified away from its Vicu\u00f1a origin. Additional significant changes in the alpaca genome also occurred during the Spanish conquest when large numbers were slaughtered, and subsequent massive hybridization with llamas. DNA studies have shown that alpaca and llama pertain to different genera, Vicugna and Lama respectively, and at least 80% of alpacas in the Andes carry llama genes (Kadwell et al. 2001). Thus, hybridization between alpacas and Vicu\u00f1as represents a real threat because of the mixing of alpaca genes into the Vicu\u00f1a genome, something that has not occurred in nature."

    "threats_description": "The major threat to this species is hunting (having replaced even forest clearance as the top threat); they are hunted both for subsistence food use and for the pet trade (Bartlett 2007, Malone et al. 2001, Osterberg et al. 2014, 2015). Hunting pressure varies across the range but takes place even within protected areas. Much of the hunting is done by villagers exploiting Aquilaria spp. trees prized for their aromatic wood, and other forest products (W. Brockelman pers. comm.). Construction of roads through protected areas (for example, the Security Highway through Nam Poyi in Lao PDR, the north-south highway in Peninsular Malaysia) may also pose a threat since it promotes forest clearance and strip development, possibly increases fragmentation, and increases access by hunters into protected areas. Ongoing localized forest loss due to shifting agriculture and commercial plantations of palm oil poses a threat. On northern Sumatra, most of the lowland forests have been logged out and the threat of Ladia Galaskar, a network to link the west and east coasts of Aceh province, means that much of the remaining forest is at risk."

    "threats_description": "Although the Indian Fox is widespread, it occurs generally at low densities throughout its range, and populations can undergo major fluctuations due to prey availability and disease (rabies and canine distemper virus have been recorded to cause local population declines in western India). They can tolerate some human disturbance, although with expanding human populations and continued development of grasslands for agricultural and industrial uses, the habitat of the Indian Fox is continuously being depleted. The combination of above factors along with disease and/or natural mortality could potentially cause localized extirpations. In certain states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, Indian Fox habitat is widespread with minimal threats, while in other states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu the habitats of the Indian Fox are under threat (Johnsingh and Jhala 2004)."

It might still remain in some areas of the lowland forest of Rio de Janeiro (Mambucaba, Angra dos Reis), but is considered extinct in lowland forests of S\u00e3o Paulo State (Brand\u00e3o and Develey 1998). Callithrix aurita faces competition from other invasive marmosets (Pereira 2006, 2010, Melo and Rylands 2008, Pereira et al. 2008, Port-Carvaho and Kierulff 2009, Nogueira et al. 2011, Bechara 2012, Carvalho et al. 2013, Carvalho 2015, Melo et al. 2015, Nunes 2015, Goncalves 2016), as well as hybridization with several of its congeners (Pereira 2010, Nogueira et al. 2011, Carvalho et al. 2013, Carvalho 2015). The species is sometimes captured for the pet trade. It is possible that introduced Callithrix jacchus and Callithrix penicillata have competed, and are still competing with and displacing this species, particularly in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Many non-native Callithrix are also interbreeding with C. aurita resulting in hybridization, although the extent of this threat needs further investigation.In the state of Rio de Janeiro, these threats are considered quite intense. Based on studies by Pereira (2006, 2010) and Pereira et al. (2008), C. aurita is certainly at a critical stage of extinction risk, especially due to the introduction of C. penicillata, C. jacchus and Callithrix hybrids into protected areas where C. aurita occurs.In the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, the risk of hybridization and competition with exotic, invasive species is also extremely worrying, but there is still no accurate diagnosis of the current situation. In the Serra da Cantareira, invaders and hybrids are both present particularly in the area surrounding PE Cantareira, a situation that did not prevail 10 years ago (M. Port-Carvalho, unpubl. data)."

    "threats_description": "The causes of the global decline are complex, are not fully understood yet, and there are many hypotheses attempting to explain the breakdown of the species. Research to identify the most important factors driving this decline is urgently needed. The decline in Western Europe has been attributed to a combination of persecution and agricultural intensification. Habitat loss and fragmentation due to intensive building of industrial estates, alongside the improvement of road networks and infrastructure, are severely disturbing natural population dynamics and lead to highly endangered \u201cisland populations\u201d. Habitat fragmentation also causes loss of genetic diversity (Banaszek et al. 2011; Banaszek and Ziomek 2012; La Haye et al. 2012; Neuman et al. 2004, 2005; Reiners et al. 2014). Agricultural intensification\u2014specifically the loss of perennial crops, the lack of crop diversity, large scale monocultural farming, and the use of pesticides\u2014are suspected to have a negative impact. Moreover, it was shown in Alsace that body mass of the hamsters at emergence from hibernation decreased by 20% in the last 70 years. It was suggested that maize monocultures and climate change have such adverse effects on body mass (Tissier et al. 2016). The current change in agricultural practices in Central and Eastern Europe is a real threat in the near future (Hegyeli et al. 2015). In former times, Common Hamster was trapped and poisoned to prevent damage to crops. The hamsters were also trapped for the fur trade (Nechay 2000). A recent analysis of reproduction parameters revealed a global decrease in the number of litters, embryos and newborns to such an extent that the populations potentially might shrink by 50% each year. The reasons for reproduction breakdown most probably are related to climate change, light pollution, or fur trapping in the past (Surov et al. 2016). Light pollution is an often underestimated threat. It acts on the physiology and behaviour of the species through endocrine and neurobiological processes which affect, amongst others, reproduction in birds and mammals (for a review see Navara and Nelson 2007, Gaston et al. 2013). For the Common Hamster there is not only a spatial coincidence between highly light polluted areas and areas with the strongest decline but also a temporal coincidence between the period of decline and increasing light intensities (Surov et al. 2016). Moreover, light exposure during only two winter nights shifted the onset of its reproductive phase by 3-4 weeks (Monecke et al. 2010). The fact that, nevertheless, some populations are doing quite well in a few cities is not a contradiction: good food availability and rain-sheltered areas within a town might override the negative effect of light pollution in these populations."

    "threats_description": "The threats to this species' habitat include selective logging and various forms of anthropogenic development and activities, alien invasive species, and hunting and trapping for sport,\u201cmedicine,\u201d food, and the pet trade. Additionally, hybridization with adjacent species poses a threat to some populations (Molur et al. 2003). Although it has a wide distribution, the species is considered to be threatened in most parts of its range. Habitat destruction is the primary cause of the decline. Habitat destruction poses the greatest risk to this species in northeastern India (Srivastava and Mohnot, 2001). However, it has been hunted in the Himalayan regions of North Bengal, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, where it frequently invades crops (Srivastava and Mohnot, 2001). Locals use skulls as an \u201cevil eye\u201d in front of houses in northeastern India (Das pers. comm.). There has been extensive habitat loss over the last 15 years in several states of northeastern India (from 30 to 60%), with major impacts on M. a. assamensis. The Nepal population of Macaca assamensis is threatened due to its restricted distribution of less than 2,200 km\u00b2 extent of occurrence and 914 km area of occupancy and continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, the number of locations and in the number of mature individuals the latter two conditions being inferred from threats to habitat and population from degradation and hunting, respectively. Given its restricted extent of occurrence, threats on its population and habitat, and small numbers in fragmented patches, the Nepal population of this macaque is categorized as Endangered.In Thailand habitat loss is the primary threat, hunting for food less so (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). It is protected only in temples.In eastern Myanmar habitat loss is the primary threat, but hunting is presumed to occur. They are hunted to make footwear, and the skins are taken to Tibet as it is more profitable than taking it to Yunnan province of China. In northern Myanmar, hunting and habitat loss due to conversion are the major threats. There is more than 30% decline in forest cover over the last 30-\u00ad35 years. The combination of habitat loss and hunting heavily impacts the subpopulations, and the threats are likely to continue in the next three decades if the demand for this continues in Tibet (S. Htun pers. comm.).In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the primary threat is hunting for food and for bones to make balm and/or glue. The bones are not used within Lao PDR, but sold to Viet Namese and traders within Lao PDR. The balm is used for pain relief and other speculative \u201cmedicinal\u201d purposes. The trade also goes into China (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). This species has declined in VietNam and Lao PDR in the last 30-35 years by more than 30%, and is expected to continue to decline in the future.In Tibet the habitat is good, but there is some hunting, and no detailed data exists for M. a. pelops from that region of China (Z. Zhou et al. pers. comm.). For M. a. assamensis, Hunting is a major threat. Logging has ceased, but was a major threat for the last 30 years. Conversion to pastures is still ongoing, but not a significant threat There are extensive habitats still left for this subspecies and the taxon is relatively safe. Habitat reduction and degradation, agricultural activities, mining, rapid developmental activities in certain areas of the macaque\u2019s distribution, hunting for food, traditional medicine, selective logging, loss of fruiting trees and human encroachment into critical macaque habitat, gold mining and shifting cultivation in Viet Nam, limestone mining destroying the macaques preferred habitats. Poaching for food and hunting for sale, political unrest in Myanmar are some existing serious threats."

    "threats_description": "Human disturbance and habitat loss (e.g., cave roosts and forest foraging habitats) are the leading threats to H. diadema populations. Caves are the preferred roost site for H. diadema and are highly vulnerable to threats compared to any land resource (Galorio and Nu\u00f1eza 2014). Such threats include limestone extraction, tourism, guano extraction, and cave swiftlet nests (Galorio and Nu\u00f1eza 2014, Kingston 2010). Destruction/disturbance of mines has also been shown to significantly threaten cave-roosting species such as H. diadema (Hall et al. 1997).Within Southeast Asia, as much of 74% of forest may be lost by the year 2100 (Sodhi et al. 2004). Singapore has lost 95% of its primary forest since the 1800s with an estimated bat species loss of about 70% (Corlett 1992, Lane et al. 2006). Similarly, the rate of deforestation in Southeast Sulawesi was 41,814 ha/year in 1985\u20131997 (Kuhutanan 2002). Throughout all of Indonesia, the Global Forest Watch reports 27Mha of tree cover loss between 2001-2019 including more than 9.5Mha of humid primary forest, further limiting bat species to protected areas (2021). Hipposideros diadema remains flexible in its utilized foraging habitats, including within highly disturbed areas (Francis 2019). However, the species is still less likely to be found in disturbed habitats and monoculture plantations (Huang et al. 2014) as it is not suited for simplified vegetation, and the expansion of coffee agriculture and other plantations have been shown to significantly reduce both bat abundance and richness (Huang et al. 2019). The increase of such activity will also likely further increase the disturbance of nearby caves, which remains the leading threat to H. diadema populations. Furthermore, simultaneous or continuous stressors, such as habitat loss and human disturbance, can increase vulnerability to pathogens and parasites (Phelps and Kingston 2018). Transmission of parasites through consumption of scavenger insects has also been observed within H. diadema and could post a risk to other population members (Galorio and Nu\u00f1eza 2014)."

Disturbance to roosts in caves and buildings may also be a problem.In some caves used by speleologists in Spain, the disturbance affects more than 90% of the population and some large historical colonies in southern Spain have disappeared as a result. The Andalucian population decreased from 30,000 individuals to 14,000 between 1994 and 2002 (unpublished report submitted to Junta Andalucia government).In Turkey and Syria caves are often used by herders and their livestock; the herders light fires in the cave entrances which disturb the bats."

    "threats_description": "Chlorocebus aethiops is a highly adaptable species that is often common where found. None-the-less, habitats over its geographic distribution are being degraded, lost, and fragmented, particularly riverine forests and lake-side woodlands (Berhanu 1975, Wolfheim 1983, Zinner et al. 2001, 2002, Butynski and Kingdon 2013, Fufa et al. 2020, Yibelu et al. 2021). Abundance can be safely assumed to be in decline with extirpation from many sites (Butler 1966, Kock 1969). This monkey is able to survive in rural and urban areas. This often results in human-monkey conflict, particularly in relation to crop-raiding. As a result, it is harassed by people and sometimes killed (Berhanu 1975, Dunbar and Dunbar 1974, Yalden et al. 1977, K\u00fcnzel et al. 2000, Zinner et al. 2001, 2002, Yibelu et al. 2021).Competition with people and livestock for water in the semi-arid parts of the range of C. aethiops is a threat, particularly as watersheds become increasingly degraded, climate change advances, and perennial sources of water are lost (Zinner et al. 2001, 2002, T. Butynski pers. obs.).Current numbers of C. aethiops captured and exported for medical research and vaccine production each year is not known. During 1968\u20131973, thousands were exported each year from Ethiopia to the United States alone (Wolfheim 1983).Main threats are expected to be human-caused habitat degradation, fragmentation, and destruction. All threats are probably related to human activities. The human population of Ethiopia is one of the fastest growing in the world with a 3% annual growth rate. At this rate. Ethiopia\u2019s population will double within 30 years (WPP 2021). \u2018Rate of Natural Increase\u2019 of the human population in Ethiopia is 2.6%, compared to a worldwide rate of 1.1% (PRB 2021).As C. aethiops is expected to interbreed with parapatric Chlorocebus taxa on the periphery of its range, this species might be locally threatened by hybridization."

    "threats_description": "This species is directly threatened by habitat loss and hunting, and indirectly by increasing human populations and the creation of easy access routes into huge areas of previously remote forests. Hunting is an increasing threat throughout the range of this taxon, which is eaten locally for food in villages and traded to urban populations. There are large areas of \u201cempty forest\u201d in its range, especially in the west, where the habitat is intact but the animals have been hunted out (see subspecies accounts for more detail). Human populations in the range states of the taxon continue to grow at roughly 2.7% annually and this rate will not slow down for several decades (UN 2015, World Bank 2016). Road access into once-remote forests \u2013 even around protected areas \u2013 has hugely increased over the last 20-30 years (Laporte et al. 2007), facilitating increased hunting and transport of bushmeat for commercial trade in both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy et al. 2013, Ziegler et al. 2016). In Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, and in East Africa (including eastern DRC and Rwanda), the species is subject to habitat modification, as intact forest is converted to farmland and \u201cfarm bush\u201d which can be seen clearly in Tyukavina et al. (2016). Historically, forest loss has been relatively low in the Gabon, CAR and Congo parts of this taxon\u2019s range (Hansen et al. 2013) due to low human population densities and selective (as opposed to clearcutting) logging practices. However, in Congo, Cameroon, DRC and Equatorial Guinea, forest loss in the years 2014-2016 was higher than in all previous years (from 2001) (WRI 2017; Gabon\u2019s figures not available), and this will greatly increase in the future as industrial agriculture expands further, removing habitat suitable for various forest-obligate species (Wich et al. 2014)."

In southern Africa, they are sporadically subject to official population control measures when they feed on crops. However, their preferred habitat, nocturnal habits and relatively high reproductive potential are such that it has proved generally difficult to eliminate Bushpig from larger tracts of relatively densely vegetated habitat (Seydack 2013). Nevertheless, with increasing human population pressure Bushpig populations are likely to become increasingly threatened in the future."

    "threats_description": "The main threats to the species include loss of habitat through deforestation, hunting for meat, road-kill, and competition with domestic livestock. The impacts of hunting on populations are amplified by the very low ability of tapir to quickly re-populate impacted areas. Though several strongholds occur - populations have been severely reduced and fragmented across the entire Cerrado (Brazil), Chaco (Argentina/ Paraguay), Atlantic forest (Brazil/ Argentina/ Paraguay) and llanos (Venezuela/Colombia) biomes. In Argentina and southern Brazil the species has been extirpated from the tropical and temperate grassland and shrubland - and are rapidly declining in the dry Chaco. Additionally the species has been extirpated from the entire Caatinga biome of north-eastern Brazil. In the northeast, tapirs are present only inside protected areas where illegal hunting is minimal. Outside protected areas, they are still hunted, chased by dogs, and negatively impacted by competition with cattle and illegal timber activities. The species is in rapid decline along the eastern Amazon and its Southern Tributaries where extensive hunting and deforestation have reduced almost all large mammal populations. In addition, populations are declining rapidly along the agricultural front spreading into western Brazil and along the Andean foothills of Ecuador and Colombia. In Argentina, T. terrestris has disappeared from around 50% of its original distribution, as a consequence of deforestation, hunting and livestock activity. The species is absent in many areas of transition between the montane forests, in important sectors of the Chaco and the Atlantic forest and completely in the Espinal. However, there are still populations in good condition in some forested areas, mainly those with limited accessibility and human activities, such as mountain forests or protected areas with strict controls. There is currently an important effort to reintroduce the species in the province of Corrientes (Esteros del Iber\u00e1). Roadkill is becoming a major threat to Tapir in the Cerrado (Brazil), the Pantanal (Brazil), and the Atlantic Forest (Argentina/Brazil) (P. Medici pers.comm, D. Varela in litt.). In Bolivia, tapirs are susceptible to hunting, and habitat degradation. While they may well be more common than expected in protected areas, as was found out in Costa Rica and elsewhere for T. bairdii, they do not fare well in the presence of hunting. In French Guiana, tapirs are regularly hunted and sold commercially for meat in markets and restaurants. Little information is available for the population in Guyana, however, tapirs are not protected there at present and are hunted by subsistence hunters as well as by a developing bush-meat industry as roads are cut into the forest for logging. In Paraguay a recent threatened species workshop assessed the Lowland Tapir as \"Vulnerable A2ac\" mainly due to habitat loss in the last 40 years, and the resulting decline in the distribution and population of the species. More than 90% of the Atlantic Forest has been lost, and the Chaco could experience the same declines over the next 30 years. Hunting and habitat loss were identified as main threats to the species. In conclusion it is difficult to calculate the overall impact of hunting on populations, but we can infer from previous studies that in the past 30 years extensive and ongoing habitat loss combined with hunting and accumulated indirect threats have been much greater than previously estimated, and much greater than would be suspected by looking at maps of remaining forest in the Amazon."

The species is hunted for meat throughout much of its range, including several regions where subsistence hunting is legal. Habitat loss and fragmentation by forest conversion into agricultural and cattle lands is particularly serious for the red brocket deer populations in the Atlantic Forest, Chaco, Brazilian Cerrado and southern Brazilian Amazon. The great scale conversion of native forests into soy bean crops are the main related reason (Varela et al. 2010)."

On the other hand, its susceptibility to rinderpest resulted in a substantial decrease in its numbers in eastern regions of Kenya during the mid-1990s. These populations can be expected to recover following the subsidence of this rinderpest outbreak. There are relatively few parts of the Lesser Kudu\u2019s range where protection against poaching reaches moderate levels or better, and eradication of rinderpest from cattle would be a major step towards reducing current pressures on its populations (East 1999)."

    "threats_description": "The reasons for decline of D. m. maculatus are a combination of habitat loss and fragmentation, possible disease at the beginning of the 20th century, competition with foxes and feral cats, predation by foxes and dogs, and impact of widespread strychnine baiting for dingoes. Most recently threats include non-target mortality from trapping and poisoning (there is a long-standing concern that quolls are being killed by the use of 1080 poisoning, but this has not been confirmed and is currently the focus of a number of investigative trials). Direct persecution is significant as they are attracted to caged birds and do not necessarily take flight when discovered. Estimated forest loss as a result of clearing within its former range in south-east Queensland is over 70%, with the majority of loss occurring over the last 20 years. The species uses a large number of den sites throughout the year and activities that reduce the number of den logs are likely to be significant. In Tasmania this taxon is naturally rare, possibly as a result of competition with D. viverrinus, Sarcophilus harrisii, and feral cats (Jones 1995). Road mortality could be a significant factor where high speed roads and good habitat coincide, as quolls are attracted to feed on the carcasses of road-killed animals (Maxwell et al. 1996).Dasyurus m. gracilis is susceptible to factors which increase juvenile and/or adult mortality, or which otherwise decrease breeding success. Such factors may include habitat clearance, logging, introduced species including cane toad, and direct killing at chicken pens, at houses, and on roads (Maxwell et al. 1996)."

    "threats_description": "The major reasons for the apparent decline include persecution (especially poisoning), decreasing natural and domestic sources of carrion due to declines in the populations of other large carnivores (Wolf, Cheetah, Leopard, Lion, Tiger) and their prey, and changes in livestock practices (Hofer 1998). Humans are consistently indicated as the major source of mortality throughout the evaluated range, largely because the hyaena is loathed as a grave robber, is associated with several superstitions (e.g. in the Middle East), and because of incidents of damage to agriculture (e.g. in Israel) and livestock (Abi-Said 2006, Bunaian et al. 2001, Hofer 1998, Al Younis 1993, Wagner 2013). Striped Hyaenas are very susceptible to accidental or targeted poisoning as they readily accept strychnine-poisoned bait. For example, along the Mediterranean coast in Israel, the Striped Hyaena was exterminated by strychnine poisoning during the rabies eradication campaign administered by the British government between 1918 and 1948. The Striped Hyaenas ate poisoned donkey carcasses that were provided to control Golden Jackals, then the main carrier of rabies. Further large-scale poisoning occurred between 1950 and 1970 (Hofer 1998). In Jordan, Lebanon, and the Palmyra area in Syria, the species is heavily persecuted (including destruction or blockage of dens, poisoning carcasses, or the use of the fire to chase animals out of dens) (Abi-Said 2006, Qarqaz et al. 2004). There is also illegal trade in skins, and body parts for use in traditional medicine (as there is elsewhere in the range), and they are often kept in cages for display purposes (G. Serra pers. comm. 2014). The species is commercially hunted in Morocco for use in traditional medicine, with various parts being used (especially the brain) and may fetch very high prices. Hunters may travel hundreds of kilometres to capture this species (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2007)."

    "threats_description": "The most pervasive threat affecting the American Pika appears to be contemporary climate change. While the species as a whole is Least Concern, large tracts of its extent of occurrence (EOO)\u2014namely across the Great Basin \u2013 have seen local population extirpations, range contractions (upslope movement of the lower-elevation range boundary), and reduced densities (Beever et al. 2003, 2010, 2011; Wilkening et al. 2011). Three alternative classes of direct thermal stresses may affect the persistence of pika populations (Beever et al. 2010): 1) acute cold stress (number of days below a very cold threshold temperature); 2) acute heat stress (number of days above a warm threshold temperature; and 3) chronic heat stress (such as average summer temperature). Acute cold stress may arise from reduced snowpack (observed across western North America; Mote et al. 2005) which in turn may result from more precipitation falling as rain and less as snow, or warmer days leading to a more rapid melt-off of snowpack, or both. Without the snowpack that acts as an insulator during winter, pikas might freeze or extinguish their food supplies while attempting to thermoregulate leading to an increase in mortality (Smith 1978, Beever et al. 2010). While some areas have extant populations at higher elevations to and from which pikas could disperse, the insular nature of talus habitat means that many populations that become extirpated will remain so on an ecological time scale \u2013 the likelihood of recolonization is extremely remote. While extinctions in the Great Basin have been going on for a long time (~7,500 years), the recent rate is high and indicative of observed increases in temperature in the region due to climate change (Beever et al. 2011). Current American Pika distributions in the Great Basin represent a perfect storm generated by the high temperatures (in summer) and reduced snowpack (in winter; Mote et al. 2005) caused by climate change.A counterbalance to the data accumulated in the Great Basin is the population of pikas at Bodie, California, at about 2,550 m elevation just 35 km west of the Sierra Nevada crest where summer temperatures are relatively warm. There pikas occupy insular patches of habitat (ore dumps left by mining activity) that are spaced across a landscape of Great Basin shrub vegetation. This classic metapopulation, the longest-term study of any pika species, has been observed since the late 1940s (Severaid 1955) and semi-continuously since 1969 (Smith 1974 a, b, 1978, 1980; Smith and Gilpin 1997), including annual censuses (with a couple of two-year gaps) from 1989 to 2010 (Smith unpublished data). Approximately 78 ore dump patches have been included in each census. In 1991 the southern half of the figure-eight-shaped study area experienced a meta-population collapse and has not recovered (Smith and Gilpin 1987); in 2010 the southern constellation of patches was still void of pikas. However, the 37 patches in the northern constellation showed a slightly higher occupancy rate in 2009 (84%; the lowest percent occupancy was 49% in the north) than in the first full census in 1972. Thus, there appears to be no evidence that heat stress in summer at Bodie causes mortality or population decline of pikas on these small habitat islands, although warm temperatures may have inhibited colonization of the southern constellation.Another largely Great Basin threat is competition with free-ranging and feral cattle in those situations where livestock are allowed to graze within the typical pika foraging distance from the talus margin (Beever et al. 2003). Most pikas live in cattle-free areas or, in Colorado, grazing temporally occurs primarily in fall after pikas have completed their haypiles. But in the Great Basin cattle graze adjoining many of the limited pika populations. Beever et al. (2003) noted that cattle grazing could be contributory to some pika population extirpations. Pika density was lower in areas that were heavily grazed\u2014primarily small sites with more edge compounding the effect of grazing (Beever unpublished data). Further, presence of livestock grazing increased in importance from the 20th century observations to the 1999-2008 observation period in terms of predicting the pattern of site-level persistence of pikas in the Great Basin (Beever et al. 2011). Millar (in press) has compared placement of pika haypiles in Great Basin ranges at sites with and without cattle grazing. Normally, pikas place their haypiles close to the talus/vegetation interface; at her cattle-free sites this distance averaged 1.8 m from the talus edge. At grazed sites pikas placed their haypiles an average of 30 m upslope from the talus edge and were forced to forage on comparatively poor vegetation growing amidst the rocks. Millar concluded that grazing effects could be contributing to observed regional differences in viability of pikas."

    "threats_description": "Habitat loss due to commercial logging and conversion to oil palm plantations and the increasing threat from poaching pose the greatest threats to the red langur. Oil palm plantations are likely to expand in the future as a result of the push for biofuels, and forest cover on the island of Borneo, if current deforestation rates continue, is projected to decline from 50% to less than one-third by 2020. The species is threatened by hunting for meat and traditional \u201cmedicine\u201d, as well as loss of habitat due to deforestation. Much habitat is being lost to expanding oil palm plantations. Nevertheless, it may be reasonably adaptable, and can occur in some secondary habitats. Further research is required to determine its persistence in logging concessions where the removal of large trees may negatively affect it. The fires of 2015 have resulted in significant forest loss across Kalimantan and this trend will continue unless steps are taken to address forest fires, especially on peatlands.Expanding oil palm plantations result in habitat loss but the langur is known to survive and tolerate, and adapt to secondary habitat. Hunting is another serious issue as they are hunted for meat and bezoar stones of commercial value. Logging affects the preferred tall trees and increases proximity to human habitation (Bersacola 2014).The population is estimated to have reduced over 50% when considering the past 30 years and projected future habitat change due to draining of peat swamps, logging and burning into the next 15 years (totalling 45 years which is approximately 3 generations). Between 2000 and 2010 the species experienced a mean 10% habitat occupancy reduction across all subspecies; P. r. chrysea experienced a ~21% habitat occupancy reduction (Ehlers Smith 2014a). Where the species persists there is hunting and collection for the wildlife trade and for human consumption. A large part of the species range is in peat swamp - an extremely threatened ecosystem."

    "threats_description": "The major threat to this species today is habitat fragmentation, with many of these fragments being further decreased. In the past, habitat loss was due mainly to timber harvest and the creation of exotic plantations such as tea, eucalyptus and coffee. Habitat degradation seems to the biggest threat to the conservation of Lion-tailed Macaques wherever they occur in Kerala (Easa et al. 1997). In private forests and plantations, change in land use is a problem for the species. Hunting is a second major threat, especially in certain parts of its range. In one location, Coorg, with a large area of remaining wet evergreen habitat, the species is highly threatened by non-subsistence and subsistence hunting for food (Kumara and Singh 2004). In some areas, primate meat is preferred as food, and so the animals face serious hunting threats (Kumara and Singh 2004). A local trade exists for pets (Molur et al. 2003), and in Coorg the animals were often hunted in the past for \u201cmedicinal\u201d uses. Certain features of the reproductive biology and ecology of this species (such as large interbirth periods, seasonal resource availability, and female competition for mating opportunities) combine to make it intrinsically rare in the wild. The populations already reduced to low numbers are in special need of active management (Singh et al. 2006). Furthermore, the Lion-tailed Macaques in the fragmented forests of Anamalai Hills were found to have less genetic diversity compared to those in a more contiguous forest in Nelliyampathy, implying that genetic inbreeding due to fragmentation and isolation may have a detrimental effect on the long-term survival of small, isolated populations (Ram et al. 2015)."

    "threats_description": "While each subspecies varies somewhat in specific suite of threats, a number of patterns have emerged that require further investigation. First, while Eastern Spotted Skunk is currently reported as infrequent, incidental captures by fur trappers and the historical overharvest could have contributed to population declines (Gompper and Hackett 2005). Second, the timing of declines in the mid 20th century coincides with the first wide-scale use of synthetic pesticides, suggesting a possible link between synthetic pesticide use and spotted skunk declines. Third, landscape change associated with modern row-crop agriculture, mesophitication of eastern forests, or other large-scale habitat alterations have negatively affected the availability of early successional forest habitat and shrub cover prefered by the species. Interestingly, this has been most recently been observed in attempts to conserve Red-cockaded Woodpecker Leuconotopicus borealis, where pine stands managed with an open understorey for conservation of the endangered woodpecker conflict with management strategies for this skunk, which requires dense understory (Lesmeister et al. 2013). Fourth, predator communities have similarly changed over the past century, potentially leading to altered competition dynamics. Fifth, a number of diseases could be linked to spotted skunk decline, including parvoviruses, distemper virus, and rabies (Gompper in revision). Overall, it is likely that simultaneously several of these threats influenced, and continue to influence, Eastern Spotted Skunk populations, and that threats could differ somewhat between subspecies. Further research is urgently needed in this area to explain the species's decline and its current distribution."

    "threats_description": "Incidental catches of Atlantic Spotted Dolphins in fisheries (e.g., bottom-set and drift gillnets, and possibly tuna purse seines) are known from several regions including North and South America (Brazil), the Caribbean, and West Africa (Ghana, Mauritania) (Perrin et al. 1994, Nieri et al. 1999, Van Waerebeek et al. 2000). In Brazil, bycatch rates for Atlantic Spotted Dolphins are reported to be lower than those for other, more coastal species (Zerbini and Kotas 1998, Di Beneditto 2003). However, there are no reliable estimates of the numbers taken in most fisheries throughout their range. In U.S. waters, fishery-related mortality is considered negligible (Waring et al. 2013). Although there is some bycatch in the U.S. Atlantic pelagic longline fleet, the numbers taken do not appear to be significant (Garrison and Stokes 2012). A notable \u201cmass mortality\u201d event was documented in Mauritania in 1995 when close to 125 Atlantic Spotted Dolphins were found dead or dying along the coast north of Nouakchott. It was determined that the animals had been caught incidentally in a local purse seine fishery for mullet (Niero et al. 1999). The only direct catches of this species occur in small-scale hunts in parts of the Caribbean (Saint Vincent), possibly in West Africa and possibly in the Azores (Jefferson et al. 2015, Perrin et al. 1994). In one study conducted in Ghana, Atlantic Spotted Dolphins comprised only 0.5% of the cetaceans that were brought to port (Debrah et al. 2010). In Venezuela, dolphin carcasses are (or at least were historically) used for shark bait and for human consumption (Perrin et al. 1994)."

    "threats_description": "In most of Canada and Alaska, trapping of lynx for the fur trade is managed through regulated seasons. Trapping can reduce lynx populations and can have the greatest impact when hare populations cyclically crash. In the 1980s, in response to concerns about over-harvest during the cyclic low of the lynx-hare cycle, Alaska and most Canadian provinces modifying seasons or bag limits to match harvest with lynx population levels and trends (Golden 1999, Mowat et al. 2000). In the early 1980s (1980-1984), an average of 35,669 Canada Lynx pelts were exported from the US and Canada during the cyclic high. By the late 1980s (1986-1989) the annual export of lynx averaged 7,360 pelts during the cyclic low. Exports have trended lower and fluctuated less severely since then, with annual exports from 2000-2006 averaging 15,387 pelts (UNEP-WCMC 2008). Historical information suggests that, despite minimal harvest controls for much of the last century, lynx-hare cycles have been largely stable in the northern part of their range and no permanent range decrease has been detected (Mowat et al. 2000, Poole 2003).In eastern Canada where lynx are protected, the primary threat is believed to be from interspecific competition from the eastern coyote, which expanded its range into eastern North America in the last few decades (Parker 2001). In southern Alberta, road density and the presence of Coyotes influenced lynx occupancy (Bayne et al. 2008). In the contiguous US, the primary threat to lynx is habitat loss or fragmentation. Maintaining connectivity with the abundant northern lynx population is considered essential for recovery of southern lynx populations (Ruediger et al. 2000, Nordstrom 2005,Walpole et al. 2012, Squires et al. 2013) especially with warmer climate (Hoving et al. 2005, Caroll 2005). Older multi-storied forest provide winter habitat for lynx and Snowshoe Hare (Koehler et al. 2008, Squires et al. 2010) in the western US fire frequency has increased four-fold in the western U.S. in boreal forests that supports lynx and this disturbance is expected to increase with warmer climate (Westerling et al. 2006) . However, young dense conifer forest also provides habitat for lynx and Snowshoe Hare, thus natural disturbance and logging practices that foster dense understoreys of conifers can benefit lynx and hares (Burdett 2008, Vashon et al. 2008, and Walpole et al. 2012). Climate change increases insect-related disturbance to boreal forests (Fleming et al. 2002, Logan et al. 2003).Interspecific competition from other predators whose populations have increased in recent decades may also affect lynx through direct mortality or competition (Bunnell et al. 2006, Bayne et al. 2008, Vashon et al. 2012, but see Kolbe et al. 2007). The USFWS concluded that trapping was not responsible for lower lynx numbers at the edge of their range (USFWS 2000). Since listed as threatened, only a few lynx are captured and die in traps or snares set for other furbearers (DelGiudice et al. 2007, Vashon et al. 2012). Although lynx have been killed on logging roads with lower traffic volumes and speeds (Vashon et al. 2012), roads with high traffic speed and volumes may result in more road mortalities (Moen et al. 2008). Although, hybridization with bobcats has been found by genetic analysis in Minnesota, Maine, and New Brunswick (Schwartz et al. 2003, Homyack et al. 2008), hybridization does not appear to threaten southern lynx populations (Homyack et al. 2008)."

    "threats_description": "Cape Genets are sometimes killed by farmers in retaliation for predation on small domestic stock and poultry, which could have an effect on numbers in some areas (Stuart 1990). Urban Genets are sometimes killed by dogs and cats, deliberately poisoned or indirectly by the consumption of poisoned rodents, and are victims of collisions with motor vehicles (C. Widdows pers. comm. 2013). However, it is believed that these sources of mortality, in addition to the non-consumptive use of this species, do not currently threaten local populations."

    "threats_description": "This species is threatened by habitat loss, which is very serious in many parts of its range. There has been extensive loss and degradation of lowland forest in Malaysia and Indonesia through clear felling to expand monocultures such as oil palm plantations, durian and rubber, for mining activities and urban and industrial expansion (Global Forest Watch 2020, 2022), as well as habitat loss/degradation through selective logging for timber extraction and forest fires/drought (Meijaard et al. 2007, ASMC 2022).Habitat loss and fragmentation through the spread of African oil palm (Elaeis guineens) seems the greatest threat to its populations, both in Indonesia and Malaysia. From 1967 to 2000, the area under oil palm cultivation here increased from less than 2000 km\u00b2 to more than 30,000 km\u00b2. In 2011, 83,000 km\u00b2 were planted with oil palm, including 20,000 km\u00b2 in Peninsular Malaysia, 24,000 km\u00b2 on Borneo, and 39,000 km\u00b2 in Sumatra (Koh et al. 2011). In 2013, this number had grown to 116,000 km\u00b2 (71,000 km\u00b2 in Indonesia and 45,000 km\u00b2 in Malaysia; Vijay et al. 2016), and the area planted with oil palm continues to increase rapidly (Meijaard and Sheil 2013). The establishment of oil palm monocultures does not only lead to loss of biodiversity but also contributes to habitat fragmentation and environmental pollution through chemical fertilizers or pesticide runoffs (reviewed in Fitzherbert et al. 2008), which directly affects M. nemestrina, who frequently uses plantations for short foraging bouts (Holzner et al. 2019, 2021a), and may thus get in direct and prolonged contact with dangerous chemicals, such as paraquat, which is a reportedly harmful herbicide (CDC 2018) still commonly used in Peninsular Malaysia (N. Ruppert, pers. obs.).During the past decade, Malaysia alone has lost 11.3% of its primary forest and 16.8% of tree cover (Mongabay, 2021) and Macaca nemestrina is reported to be sensitive to timber harvest (Meijaard et al. 2007), and has experienced a 10% decline in local site occupancy in heavily disturbed and clear-cut forest sites over a period of only four years, recently (2013-2017; Holzner et al. 2021b).Human-wildlife conflict and a generally negative public perception of this species is quite severe. Macaca nemestrina has consistently been in the Top-5 list of public complaints about wildlife filed to the Department of Wildlife and National Parks Peninsular Malaysia (mean 298 annual complaints between 2013\u20132018 for Peninsular Malaysia alone; DWNP 2018). Negative public perceptions also occur due to crop foraging, which results in the macaques being perceived as pests. A study on crop foraging by Linkie et al. (2007) in Sumatra found that M. nemestrina was one of the most frequently reported crop foragers for rice, banana and papaya here. However, in Peninsular Malaysia, it was shown that M. nemestrina frequently forages in oil palm plantations but causes little damage to ripe oil palm fruits (&lt;0.6%); it instead contributes to increasing oil palm yield by foraging on pest rodents in plantations (Holzner et al. 2019). However, due to the high infant mortality, palm oil plantations are not suitable habitats for the species, and it needs healthy forest adjacent to the plantations. Also, the publication by Holzner et al. (2019) led to a misunderstanding regarding the role of the species in oil palm plantations and its habitat needs, with the public assuming the species would thrive in oil palm plantations alone, which is not the case (N. Ruppert, pers. obs.).In all range countries, the species along with M. leonina is used in the coconut plucking industry and the entertainment industry, which further threatens its survival (e.g., Bangkok Post 2015).There is ongoing and active trade of the species, especially in Indonesia, where the species is still offered for sale in markets, and 1,274 individuals were offered for sale on Facebook in 2020/21 alone (Anonymous, unpublished results). The illegal online pet trade of this species is also rampant in Malaysia (Zainol et al. 2018). Macaca nemestrina is increasingly sought for use in biomedical science studies for HIV/AIDS and other infectious disease research (e.g., Ha et al. 2000, Lee et al. 2021, Ritter et al. 2013), and hunted for food (Bernstein 1967, Lappan and Ruppert 2019)."

Van Pelt pers. comm.).USFWS (2006) found that a petition to list this species as threatened or endangered did not present substantial scientific information indicating that a listing may be warranted under any pertinent threat factors. USFWS acknowledged that sylvatic plague has been and continues to be the primary mortality factor for Gunnison's prairie dog, especially at specific sites, but concluded that the impact that this disease has had on the overall status of the species is unclear. This species reproduces slowly relative to other rodents, and survivorship is low (Hoogland 2001)."

They are also indirectly killed by non-selective control programmes targeting other species, such as jackals (Canis spp.) and Caracal (Caracal caracal; Begg et al. 2013). There is evidence to suggest they have gone locally extinct in many areas through poisoning (C. Begg and K. Begg pers. obs. 2006). Although there is little apiculture in areas of North Africa where the species occurs (except near the Lower Draa area, in Morocco), they are persecuted there (trapping, poisoning; K. de Smet and F.

    "threats_description": "Depletion of prey base: This may be the single greatest factor that contributed to the range collapse of Dholes in the northern half of their former distribution, and might be the primary factor for the continued decline of Dholes in the southern half of their distribution. Throughout Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and southeastern China, ungulate populations are well below carrying capacity due to over hunting by humans, even within protected areas (Durbin et al. 2004). All ungulate species, except perhaps Muntjac (Muntiacus spp.) and Wild Pig (Sus scrofa), are ecologically or fully extinct across extensive parts of the region (Durbin et al. 2004). This situation will likely hinder any possibility of recovery by the region's Dhole populations, even if the other issues could be addressed. Dholes can probably persist as fragmented populations in large protected areas of Bhutan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Indonesia (Sumatra and Java) and Thailand, as long as prey numbers remain sufficient and other threats are controlled. In large protected areas in southern and central India, Dhole numbers are stable where prey densities are high. In northeastern India, prey depletion is contributing to the decline of Dholes in the region (Gopi et al. 2012).Habitat loss and transformation: Habitat loss and degradation are serious threats to Dholes in southern Asia, particularly because this threat is closely associated with prey depletion and high levels of human disturbance. Although extensive areas of natural or semi-natural vegetation remain in Lao PDR and Cambodia, habitat conversion and fragmentation are proceeding unabated. In Viet Nam, very few natural areas greater than 50 km2 remain. Habitat loss and fragmentation is a major threat to protected areas in Indonesia, particularly those on Sumatra. Habitat loss is driven by several different factors, including logging, palm and rubber plantations, agriculture expansion, rural biomass extraction, livestock grazing and major infrastructure expansion (e.g., hydropower dams, irrigation projects, new highways, etc.).Persecution: Persecution of Dholes stems mainly from retaliatory killings due to livestock predation, and this factor is driving some Dhole populations towards local extinction (Lyngdoh et al. 2014). Dholes appear to be especially susceptible to poisoning of carcasses using strychnine or other rodenticides, which often are readily available to rural people in southern Asia. Consequently, unsystematic but consistent poisoning of carcasses can easily wipe out Dholes within an area, especially because the entire pack will feed on a carcass. For example, poisoning of livestock carcasses apparently wiped out Dholes from Bhutan in the 1970s and early 1980s, although this species began to re-occupy the country starting in the 1990s (Wangchuk 2004, Thinley et al. 2011). Killing of Dholes by poisoning livestock carcasses also has been reported in China, Nepal, India and Indonesia, and is likely is widespread in southern Asia. Poisoning campaigns also were thought to have contributed to the extirpation of Dholes in the countries of the former Soviet Union (Ginsberg and Macdonald 1990). Dholes reportedly have been shot by humans, as Dhole carcasses with gun-shot wounds were found near the boundary of protected areas in Thailand (K. Jenks and N. Songsasen unpubl.). Dholes are probably susceptible to non-selective snaring, particularly where this activity is widespread such as in Viet Nam, Cambodia, China and Lao PDR. In India, and possibly elsewhere, Dholes living outside or on the edge of core protected areas are particularly vulnerable to human kleptoparasitism.Disease and pathogens: Dholes are susceptible to rabies, canine distemper, canine parvovirus and sarcoptic mange among others (Durbin et al. 2004), which are usually contracted from domestic village dogs that act as reservoirs. Dholes appear to be especially susceptible to disease epizootics due their large pack sizes and high levels of amicable behaviour within packs, even among adults (Johnsingh 1982). Such behaviours likely result in relatively high intraspecific contact rates, which are conducive for disease epizootics, at least compared to other wild canids such as jackals (Canis aureus) which are more solitary. Disease epizootics may contribute to the sudden disappearance of Dholes from protected areas, and often cause severe local population fluctuations resulting in relatively small pack sizes (Karanth and Sunquist 2000, J. Kamler pers. obs.). In Cambodia, a recent outbreak of canine distemper in 2011-2012, thought to have originated in local domestic dogs, caused the near-extirpation of Dholes from protected areas in the eastern and northern parts of the country (J. Kamler unpubl.), although populations appear to be recovering; mortalities associated with canine distemper also have been observed in a protected area in Thailand (N. Songsasen and K. Jenks unpubl). The range-wide effects of diseases on Dhole population dynamics is unknown, but it is likely significant across southern Asia, and might result in an increased probability of extirpation for Dhole populations in isolated protected areas.Competition with other species: Aside from humans, the main competitors of Dholes for limited resources are Tigers (Panthera tigris) and Leopards (P. pardus). Although Dholes are much smaller in body size, packs of Dholes reportedly have killed both Tigers and Leopards, although the reverse also has been reported (Burton 1940). The dominance hierarchy between Dholes and Tigers is not clear, although Dholes likely avoid tigers especially if packs are small. Dholes appear to be behaviourally dominant over Leopards, and packs of Dholes often tree this species when they interact (Venkataraman 1995). Whether large felids can negatively affect Dhole numbers is unknown, although the exploitive and interference competition between them likely becomes more intense as prey populations are reduced by humans, possibly resulting in spatial exclusion where prey numbers are lowest. Free-ranging dogs also may compete with Dholes for limited food resources where prey numbers are low."

    "threats_description": "The main threat in Europe is the increased mixing of various genetic pools as a result of translocations. This may be a particular threat to genetically distinct peripheral populations, such as those in northern Portugal, the southern Italian Apennines, and Greece (Randi et al. 2004, Lorenzini and Lovari 2006). Molecular studies show that Roe Deer in central and southern Europe are mainly admixed (Lorenzini et al. 2002, Randi et al. 2004), indicating that human manipulation has greatly affected the natural genetic structure of populations. The small isolated populations of Capreolus c. italicus in central and southern Italy (Castelporziano, Rome, and Gargano National Park) are also threatened by poaching and predation by free-ranging dogs Canis familiaris (Lorenzini et al. 2002). The small remnant population in Syria is under severe threat from habitat reduction and human persecution (Masseti 2000). Illegal hunting, poaching, collisions with vehicles mainly in the western Black Sea Region, and predation by dogs, are the main threats to the species in Turkey."

There is also a lack of suitable hollows in most habitat remnants on the inland slopes and regeneration of trees and shrubs is hindered by grazing by stock, rabbits, macropods, and inappropriate fire regimes.

    "threats_description": "Outside protected areas, populations are subject to persecution by humans through culling (shooting and spearing), trapping and poisoning. Such activities may sometimes occur within the boundaries of conservation areas: mortality due to wire snares set to catch wild herbivores for meat is an important cause of adult mortality in the Serengeti, where snares kill around 400 adult Spotted Hyaenas each year and are responsible for more than half of all adult mortality (Hofer et al. 1996). Apparently only since the mid-1970s has game meat hunting rapidly expanded, as more people have moved within walking distance of the boundaries of protected areas such as in the north and west of the Serengeti (Hofer 1998). Entire clans of Spotted Hyaenas may be killed by poisoning (Holekamp et al. 1993), and many individuals are killed when hit by vehicles. Spotted Hyaena populations in protected areas may be decimated by authorities when they are considered a threat for other wildlife species such as lions, cheetahs and rhinos. Government officials and managers may also allow local human residents within protected areas to kill Spotted Hyaenas when they are suspected or known to have preyed upon livestock. The numbers killed by licensed sport hunters are probably small as they are not considered an attractive species. It is also killed for food, medicine and witchcraft (Hofer and Mills 1998b). A further threat is posed by the decline in densities of wildlife species consumed by Spotted Hyaenas due to habitat loss caused by increased human settlement, overgrazing by livestock, and game-meat hunting by humans."

    "threats_description": "This species has a relatively restricted range in a region that has undergone extensive deforestation over the last 50 years (Rasmussen et al. 2002). However, it remains relatively common within its range, and is able to persist in slightly modified habitats. Nonetheless, there may be localized declines taking place due to ongoing habitat loss. In Panama, the species is frequently hunted and captured for the pet trade (M\u00e9ndez-Carvajal 1999, Rasmussen et al. 2002). There have been attempts to introduce this species by local people in the Veraguas Province, including western Azuero, but with unsuccessful results. Saguinus geoffroyi is often road killed in areas near Parque Nacional Metropolitano (M\u00e9ndez-Carvajal 2001), and Parque Nacional Soberan\u00eda (M\u00e9ndez-Carvajal 2001). The main reason for population decline is urbanization in the East of Panama Provinces and loss of mangroves in the vicinity of Tocumen International Airport (M\u00e9ndez-Carvajal 1999).In Colombia, it is reported that trapping and trade of this species occurs west of the R\u00edo Atrato (Defler 2004)."

    "threats_description": "There are no major threats to the species, although the increase in agriculture and human settlements have reduced available habitat. Localised declines occur due to habitat transformation and loss of dense vegetation in some areas. For example, Cape Grysbok ranges have seen local declines in numbers from areas such as the AENP where escalating numbers of elephants have opened up or destroyed thicket habitats (Castley and Lloyd 2013, Tambling et al. 2013). Additionally, some game farms are over stocked and under managed resulting in the opening up of areas of dense vegetation, thus reducing habitat for Cape Grysbok. Even where numbers are not excessive, extra-limital browsers can compete for forage and space (Spear and Chown 2009, Spear et al. 2011).Cape Grysbok are illegally hunted with dogs, which may lead to local subpopulation declines. They are also both accidentally and deliberately caught with snares for bush meat. Localised unsustainable offtakes of trophy males for hunting may lead to population structure disruptions and localised declines.Additionally, the habitat available to this species is declining in area and quality. Agriculture and urbanisation has reduced habitat, but there has not been a severe decrease in habitat quality. For example, Pence (2014) calculated that between 2006 and 2011, 536 km\u00b2 of land was converted to agriculture in the Western Cape Province (107 km\u00b2 per year, which equates to 0.08% of the surface area of the province per year). Urban human settlements have expanded by 8.6% and 6.3% between 2000 and 2013 in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, respectively (GeoTerraImage 2015), which we infer to mean increasing mortality from poaching, snaring and dog hunting. Even though there may not be any empirical evidence for specific impacts of extra-limital species on Cape Grysbok, several publications have highlighted the detrimental impacts of introducing extra-limital and/or exotic species that compete for resources with an endemic species (Castley et al. 2001, Spear and Chown 2009, Spear et al. 2011). Observational data from AENP further indicate that the increase in numbers of larger herbivores is associated with declines in the more cryptic species (for example, Grysbok and Bushpig). Finally, we suspect that habitat loss from agricultural expansion may become likely as climate change makes marginal habitats more suitable for cultivation. For example, climate change is projected to increase the suitability of upslope habitats for viticulture, increasing the footprint of winelands by 14% by 2050 (Hannah et al. 2013)."

    "threats_description": "Forest loss, degradation and fragmentation are all potential threats to Small-toothed Palm Civet. There is no evidence that it can survive in areas without tree cover, and, as yet, no evidence for population persistence in landscape remote from native forest. The heavy widespread ongoing deforestation in South-east Asia in the last half-century will thus have greatly reduced the area available to the species, and in areas retaining high levels of forest conversion (e.g. Sumatra) declines are doubtless ongoing. Much forest has also been degraded and fragmented: the available evidence suggests this will have had relatively little effect (e.g., Viet Nam: Willcox et al. 2012; Singapore: Chua et al. 2012; Java: Moore and Wihermanto 2014). Although there is as yet no confirmation of large numbers in higher montane areas (over 1,500 m) there is still a sizeable altitudinal band holding the species above the zone of heaviest forest clearance, the lowlands. Hunting is another potential threat but in reality seems to have little effect on the species's populations within remaining habitat. Especially in Indochina, where general mammal hunting levels are extremely high, most active hunting is with dogs and projectiles by day, and most passive trapping (snares etc.) is at ground level. The species's nocturnal, arboreal, habits therefore insulate it from the sort of heavy pressures facing ground-dwelling and/or diurnal species (Willcox et al. 2012). Active night hunting appears to be the only effective means of hunting this civet and, because this is labour-intensive, is relatively rarely undertaken for arboreal mammals in most of this species's range (e.g. Walston and Duckworth 2003). In Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Myanmar, spotlight hunting does occur, but again the impact on this species is minimal because hunters focus on taking higher market value species (in terms of yield per unit effort) such as ungulates and frogs, and concentrate for these almost exclusively at ground level (e.g. Walston and Duckworth 2003)."

    "threats_description": "The Greater One-horned Rhinoceros declined to near extinction in the early 1900s, primarily due to widespread conversion of alluvial plains grasslands to agricultural development, which led to human-rhino conflicts and easier accessibility for hunters. Sport hunting became common in the late 1800s and early 1900s. A reversal of government policies shortly thereafter protected many of the remaining populations. However, poaching, mainly for the use of the horn in Traditional Asian Medicine, has remained a constant threat and the success is precarious without continued support for conservation efforts in India and Nepal. Past poaching led to declines in several important populations, especially those in Chitwan, Manas, Laokhowa, and the Babai Valley area of Bardia, but in the past 5 years, poaching has decreased and the populations in these areas are increasing (except for Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary).However, not all recent population decreases can be linked to poaching. There have been serious declines in quality of habitat in some areas. This is due to: 1) severe invasion by alien plants into grasslands affecting some populations; 2) demonstrated reductions in the extent of grasslands and wetland habitats due to woodland encroachment and silting up of beels; and 3) grazing by domestic livestock. In Chitwan National Park (the second largest population), poaching alone does not account for the observed level of population decline (R.H. Emslie pers. comm.), and there are trends in a number of reproductive indicators (i.e., decline in the percentage of adult females calving and in the percentage of the population that is calves) that are strongly indicative of negative changes in habitat quality. In Chitwan, there has been severe infestation of some riverine and grassland areas by the climbing Mikania micrantha (which covers over indigenous vegetation), and invasion of Eupatorium in other areas (Murphy, et al., 2013). There is also heavy livestock grazing pressure and disturbance in buffer zone areas as well as some invasion of grasslands by Acacia catechu and Dalbergia sissou. In India, there is not yet any evidence that invasion by alien plants has caused any population decreases. However, in Orang National Park, there have been marked habitat changes due to grazing, human encroachment and silting up. In particular, short grass areas have declined by 75% due to silting up and draining of beels, lake-like wetlands with static water (B.N. Talukdar, pers. comm.). Mimosa is also an alien invader in this area. In the Karnali floodplain area of Bardia there is also some invasion of habitat by the alien Lantana camara. In Pabitora, there has been an invasion of Ipomoea spp. \"weeds\" and Parthenium spp. into grassland areas (S. Dutta, pers. comm.). There also has been an invasion of woodland into grassland and siltation and drying up of some water bodies. There also has been some human encroachment and very heavy livestock grazing. With increasing human densities this pressure is unlikely to get any less (S. Dutta pers. comm.). Analysis of satellite imagery has shown that there has a substantial increase in woodland (34.51%) in Pabitora since 1977 accompanied by decline in alluvial grassland (68%) (Sarma et al. 2009). This change of habitat is mostly because of natural succession process, livestock grazing from the nearby villages as well as improper management of the grassland habitat (Sarma et al. 2009). The West Bengal populations (Jaldapara and Gorumara) are affected by high levels of grazing from fringe villages, and there have been weed and climber infestations by Mikania cordata, M. scandens, Lantana camara, Christella dentata, and Leea spp. The species is inherently at risk because over 70% of its population occurs at a single site, Kaziranga National Park. This area, is subject to poaching and tensions with the surrounding high human population due to human-wildlife conflicts (including conflicts with rhinos). The level of poaching in Kaziranga has generally not been at a level to prevent the ongoing increase in the population, but constant vigilance is required. At least 12 rhinos were lost in the July 2019 monsoon floods, and numerous calves were rescued. Any severe catastrophic event in Kaziranga (such as disease, civil disorder, poaching, habitat loss, etc.) would have a devastating impact on the species.During surveys carried out in February 2019, Jaldapara and Gorumara reported figures of 231 and 52 rhinos respectively - the highest numbers recorded during the last 100 years. There are suggestions that the two protected areas have reached their carrying capacities and suitable areas need to be found for the West Bengal populations. A male:female:unknown sex ratio of 3.8.1 has been reported in the Gorumara population based on dung DNA analysis (Borkathur, et al. 2016). As a result, fights among bulls are very common and these animals often stray out of the National Park, leading to human-wildlife conflicts (S. S. Bist, pers. comm).There are suggestions that the small population of rhinos in Jaldapara and Gorumara may be prone to inbreeding depression (S.S. Bist, pers. comm.).There have been proposals to dam the Bramaphutra River in Arunachal Pradesh, and should this happen in future things could very negatively affect the habitat quality and rhino carrying capacity of major parks like Kaziranga in future (by preventing or reducing the pulse of nutrients brought in by regular large floods). In Jaldapara National Park, the River Torsa no longer overflows as a result of massive flood-control structures. As a result the water table in Jaldapara National Park is receding and the natural water-bodies and wallow-pools used by rhinos are slowly drying up (S.S. Bist, pers. comm)."

Where this species inhabits grassland habitats it is particularly susceptible to fires. In Brazil, burning of sugar cane plantations prior to their harvest leads to the death of significant numbers of giant anteaters due to severe burn injuries (F. Miranda pers. comm. 2013). Animals are sometimes killed on roads or by dogs. Giant anteaters are hunted for food throughout their distribution, and are additionally hunted as a pest, for pets or for illegal trade in some parts of their range."

In the San Joaquin Valley of California, habitat conversion for agriculture is slowing, but habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation associated with industrial and urban development are still occurring at a rapid pace. More recently, expansive industrial-scale solar energy generating facilities are being constructed throughout the western USA, but particularly in California, Arizona, and Nevada."

    "threats_description": "The overall range of the Gelada is being eroded by agricultural expansion resulting from rapid human population growth in the Ethiopian highlands. Conversion of Gelada habitat to farmland and livestock grazing is common (Bergman and Beehner 2013) and soil erosion is a serious problem throughout the region (Nyssen et al. 2015). Grazing pressure is intense, and competition from domestic livestock has forced the Gelada to remain on the less productive gorge slopes in some areas (e. g. eastern Arsi) (Abu et al. 2018). Gelada densities are considerably lower in heavily populated areas than in undisturbed habitats (R. Burke, pers. obs.). Geladas are also harassed, shot or hunted with dogs as crop pests (R. Burke, pers. obs.) and occasionally sold locally as pets (Bergman and Beehner 2013). In the past, Geladas were trapped for zoos though this practice no longer occurs. Also, in the past, adult male numbers were reduced as a result of selective shooting for their capes of hair, which were made into ceremonial costumes used by the Oromo people (Dunbar 1977). The extent of this practice today is unknown. There are also historic records of Gelada capes being made into fur hats for tourists (Dunbar 1977). Government-sanctioned trophy hunting of Geladas by tourists is currently allowed in controlled hunting areas, although the extent and impact of this practice are unknown. Parasitic swellings caused by tapeworms (Taenia serialis) are a major cause of death in some Gelada populations (Nguyen et al. 2015, Schneider-Crease et al. 2017). Climate change poses a long-term threat to Geladas, especially for populations inhabiting higher elevations, where agriculture has previously been impossible or uncommon (Dunbar 1998)."

    "threats_description": "Changing land use, resulting from agriculture, urban development, and forest ingrowth, appears to be a major factor negatively affecting American Badger. Declines may also be related to the persecution of its primary prey, prairie-dogs and ground squirrels (Apps et al. 2002). Finley et al. (1976) speculated that some Colorado populations may have declined because of the elimination of prairie-dogs. Roadkills and habitat loss are the main threats in British Columbia (Newhouse and Kinley 2012). Trapping for pelts has in the past affected populations, mainly in response to high fur prices, but has not had a significant influence on populations in recent years. Badgers are also trapped, shot and poisoned because their diggings are thought to cause broken legs in livestock, lead to water loss from irrigation canals, and cause damage to vehicles encountering their burrows (Scobie 2002).Although clearing of forests for agricultural land has probably resulted in some range expansion, cultivation of grassland has undoubtedly caused declines (Soper 1964, Stardom 1979, Lindzey 1982, Smith 1992). Likewise, intensification of agriculture is likely to cause declines in the future.Much mortality is caused by vehicles or deliberate killing by people (Stardom 1979, Messick et al. 1981, Newhouse and Kinley 2012, Apps et al. 2002). Badgers may actually be attracted to roads, both because ground squirrels often burrow alongside them (Ketcheson and Bauer 1995), and because they are good travel routes (Warner and Ver Steeg 1995)."

    "threats_description": "Hunted for sport and local subsistence. Increased predation may be a threat for this species. In some places animal competition (livestock), habitat fragmentation, and exotic grasses represent important threats to populations. Competition from Black-tailed Jackrabbits may be a threat due to habitat changes. Habitat loss due to agriculture is a significant threat to the species (Brown et al. 2018). The greatest impact on the population of L. a. tiburonensis on Tiburon Island is the presence of predators -- a high density of Coyotes and a lower density Gray Fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Also, populations of Mule Deer (Odocoileus hemionus sheldoni) may compete for food and habitat use with this subspecies (Lorenzo et al. 2014, 2018)."

In general, however, it remains common.Although the range of the species contracted in Australia with European settlement, the species is adaptable and has survived well even in modified habitat (Gordon 2008). Depredation by domestic dogs, however, may be a problem in some areas. In Queensland, Australia it has contracted from part if its range in inland pastoral country and has undergone local contraction in distribution elsewhere due to the impact of development, farming, and grazing (G. Gordon pers. comm.). Inappropriate fire regimes, in the form of too frequent burning, have resulted in declines in some regions, particularly across the tropical savanna in the north."

    "threats_description": "The main threat to Common Impala seems to be active poaching at the edge of, and within, protected areas (with strong influence on densities as well as population structure) combined with agro-pastoral development (Setsaasa et al. 2007, Averbeck et al. 2009). Hunting risk is also likely to affect Impala behaviour, such as change in habitat selection or waterhole attendance (Crosmary et al. 2012). Poaching, livestock development and severe drought were the main factors contributing to the decline of Black-faced Impala (Green and Rothstein 1998, East 1999). The reintroduction of 180 individuals from Kaokoland to the west of Etosha National Park between 1968 and 1971 helped promote the conservation of the Black-faced subspecies, and a few were translocated from Etosha to private game farms in Namibia (Fritz and Bourgarel 2013). However, the introduction of Common Impala to ranches and conservancies neighbouring Etosha National Park may represent a threat to the Black-faced Impala through hybridization. Green and Rothstein (1998) earlier estimated that about one-quarter of all privately owned Black-faced Impala occur in mixed herds with Common Impala. In a recent study, Lorenzen and Siegismund (2004) analysed 127 Black-faced Impala individuals from five subpopulations in Etosha National Park to determine whether any hybridization had taken place within the park, but could not find any definite evidence."

    "threats_description": "Modern intensive forestry and logging are the major threats to this species (Hanski et al. 2001). Large tracts of mature boreal forest have been felled and replaced by a managed forest landscape that is a mosaic of semi-natural forest, young saplings, and clear-cut patches. Fragmentation of forests is a particular problem for this species, as flying squirrels are reluctant to cross open areas on the ground. Managed forests also tend to have fewer deciduous trees (which are an essential winter food source), less decaying wood and fewer tree-holes (which are needed for nest-sites). In parts of Russia, it has been estimated that up to 50% of logging is illegal (Kotlobay and Ptichnikov 2002). Illegal logging is particularly destructive, as unsustainable practices such as high-grading or 'skimming' are used, meaning that for every ten trees felled only one or two high-quality logs will be used (Kotlobay and Ptichnikov 2002). The species is also hunted for commercial use of its fur, but this is not considered a major threat at present (Nowak 1991).In Mongolia, habitat loss caused by selective logging, human-caused fires and natural wildfires in some parts of its range are a threat."

In decreasing order they include: 1) Habitat degradation and loss induced by extremely heavy grazing by livestock (Rubenstein 2010, Low et al. 2009); 2) Competition with livestock, especially over access to water and high quality rangeland (Rowen and Ginsberg 1992; Williams 2002, 2013); 3) Local hunting for meat as well as medicinal and cultural purpose; 4) Disease from contact with unvaccinated livestock, especially with respect to anthrax and babesiosis (Hawkins et al. 2015); 5) Hybridization with plains Zebras, although genes currently only flow from Grevy\u2019s to plains Zebras (Cordingley et al. 2009); 6) Predation (Rubenstein 2010); 7) Anticipated land conversion for resort development and other large-scale initiatives for economic expansion.In Kenya, hunting for skins in the late 1970s was the likely cause of the initial precipitous decline in numbers. Recent data suggest that numbers continued to decline because recruitment was limited by low levels of infant and juvenile survival. This was a result of competition for resources \u2013 both food and water \u2013 with pastoral people and their domestic livestock (Williams 1998). However, a low level of hunting of Grevy\u2019s Zebra for food and, in some areas, medicinal uses continues (Williams pers. comm. 2002). Furthermore, access to existing water sources continues to decline in some regions and the water supply in critical perennial rivers has been reduced, most notably in the Ewaso Ng\u2019iro River where over-abstraction of water for irrigation schemes has reduced dry season river flow by 90% over the past three decades (Williams pers. comm. 2002).In Ethiopia, the Grevy\u2019s Zebra population was in a declining trend during the last 30 years, due to habitat loss/fragmentation, drought, poaching and potential competition with livestock. Habitat loss, drought and poaching were considered to be the major threats. Illegal killing of Grevy\u2019s Zebra was the primary cause of the decline (Kebede 2013). The Alledeghi Wildlife Reserve population is small and genetically isolated. Initial population genetics research on the mtDNA control region revealed two new haplotypes that so far are not found in any other Grevy\u2019s Zebra populations. The nucleotide diversity levels for both the Alledeghi and the southern Ethiopian populations were extremely low (Kebede et al. 2014).Recently, Muoria et al. (2007) recorded an outbreak of anthrax in the Wamba area of southern Samburu, Kenya, during which more than 50 animals succumbed to the disease. Further research on disease prevalence is revealing that Grevy\u2019s Zebra are a reservoir for Theileria and Babesia (tick borne disease), and the first case of West Nile Virus has been found in one individual; the first detected in a wild equid (Hawkins et al. 2015). Disease represents a significant potential threat to fragmented and small populations of endangered species."

    "threats_description": "In general, habitat loss, persecution and hunting are considered to be the major threats. This species is considered locally threatened in parts of its range by severe deforestation, and more generally across West and Central Africa by hunting for food and medicinal use. It is the most heavily harvested bat for bushmeat in West and Central Africa, and one of the most frequently consumed mammals in this region (P. Racey personal communication). Large pre-migration colonies are considered particularly vulnerable to any threats. In some areas this species is considered to be a pest and roosting trees may be cut down. Trees are also cut down in order to catch bats for the market (P. Racey personal communication). More recently, people are afraid of large concentrations bats due to Ebola outbreaks in Central and West Africa and may remove important roost trees to evict the colonies."

Other threats include: high predator populations (including feral dogs), competition with livestock grazing, human habitat alterations and other anthropogenic forces. Although most of the subspecies are not threatened, the Cedro Island subspecies (Odocoileus hemionus cerrocensis) is considered to be Vulnerable (IUCN 1988) because of the low numbers and the high predation by feral dogs and poaching."

    "threats_description": "The Roan Antelope has been eliminated from large parts of its former range because of poaching and loss of habitat to the expansion of settlement and agriculture, for example cotton farming (Chardonnet and Crosmary 2013). It now survives mainly in and around protected areas and in other areas with low densities of people and livestock. Its persistence in West Africa is probably due to its ability to withstand illegal hunting pressures better than many other large herbivores, especially the more water dependant and more sedentary species which are more exposed to poaching (East 1999, Chardonnet and Crosmary 2013).Different explanations have been provided for the decline of Roan and its lack of subsequent recovery in the Kruger N.P. in South Africa, 450 animals in 1986 to around 30 in 2001 (Harrington et al. 1999, Grant et al. 2002). The most likely reason is increased predation pressure by Lions, following the influx of grazers following construction of artificial waterpoints (Knoop and Owen-Smith 2006). Illegal hunting probably contributed to the decline of the Roan Antelope in Masai Mara N.R. in Kenya in the 1970s (Hofer et al. 1996)."

    "threats_description": "Current threats to this species include continued habitat destruction, fragmentation, and modification (which makes them vulnerable to predation by dogs, vehicle strikes, and other factors), bushfires, and disease, as well as drought associated mortality in habitat fragments. Public concern for the species is high. There are management problems with many populations; remnant populations living at high densities in isolated patches of habitat are at greatest risk (Martin et al. 2008). Effective management of some of the threats on the mainland could lead to excessive abundance and result in pest problems similar to those occurring on Kangaroo Island and in parts of Victoria.The overall distribution of Koalas has been reduced since European settlement. This decline was primarily due to disease, bushfires, and widespread habitat destruction in the early decades of the 20th century. Commercial harvesting also took place across the range towards the end of the 19th century and early 20th century (large numbers, running into the millions, were killed for their pelts for a large export industry in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland). This was banned in Victoria in the 1890s, and it continued sporadically (and under regulation) in Queensland until 1927 (Hrdina and Gordon 2004). There is no evidence, however, that the early spate of commercial harvesting had any long-term impact on the overall population. Climate change is likely to have severe consequences for this species (Adams-Hosking et al. 2011a,b, 2012)."

    "threats_description": "Threats fall into four main categories. 1) Exotic disease, particularly sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis) to which prairie dogs are highly susceptible. 2) Loss of habitat to agriculture and urbanization. 3) Habitat fragmentation and its many effects. 4) Control activities by government, private organizations, and individuals via poisoning and shooting. EXOTIC SPECIES/DISEASE: Sylvatic plague was introduced to North America around 1899 (Cully 1989) and first reported in black-tailed prairie dogs from Texas in the mid-1940s (Reading et al. 1989). It is a serious threat given its pervasiveness and efficacy, as it can kill more than 99% of prairie dogs in a colony (Cully 1989), and numbers do not appear to fully recover (USFWS 2002). Though prairie dogs have persisted in the presence of plague since about 1900 and prairie dog numbers are high given habitat loss and control efforts, plague is still of concern to local populations and for long-term persistence. Plague is not well documented in black-tailed prairie dogs across their range though there is no reason to believe that plague is not as significant in black-tailed as it is in white-tailed prairie dogs (Cully 1992). On large areas originally selected as possible ferret reintroduction sites, declines of up to 90 per cent from about 1985-2000 are \"generally attributed to sylvatic plague\" (USFWS 2000). Only about 10 percent of the historical range is both plague-free and available (not cropland) (USFWS 2000). Widespread outbreaks in 2001 may indicate the beginning of an 'up' cycle in plague occurrence (USFWS 2002). The significance of plague in range-wide prairie dog mortality is unclear, though experts agree that where plague occurs it is extremely important in population dynamics (Cully 1992). Plague may be introduced into a colony by other species or by dispersing prairie dogs, which bring plague-ridden fleas into a colony.USFWS (2004) noted that: (1) High exposure doses of plague bacilli may be necessary for disease contraction in some individuals; (2) limited immune response has been observed in some individuals; (3) a population dynamic may have developed in low-density, isolated populations that contributes to the persistence of these populations; (4) the apparent ability of some sites to recover to pre-plague levels after a plague epizootic; and (5) approximately one-third of the species' historic range has not been affected by plague. Based on this and on recent estimates of occupied habitat, USFWS (2004) concluded that plague no longer appears to be as significant a threat as previously thought and that plague in combination with other factors is not likely to cause the black-tailed prairie dog to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future.HABITAT LOSS AND DEGRADATION: Habitat loss has been an important factor in prairie dog declines in the past. Cheatheam (1977) estimated that about 36% of the land area in regions used by prairie dogs was covered by water developments, urban expansion, cropland, and improved pasture. Similarly, Bishop and Culbertson (1976) detected extensive colony loss on river terraces as a result of farming activities. Conversion of native prairie to farmland does not necessarily represent habitat loss to prairie dogs, but farmers will not tolerate prairie dogs in their fields (Merriam 1902). Similarly, prairie dogs prosper in empty urban lots and fields, yet this is not often tolerated given the plague risk. However, in New Mexico, urban (Gunnison's) prairie dogs are often allowed to remain because colony fleas are killed instead. Still, developments that destroy patches of grassland (e.g., roads, buildings, water impoundments) result in loss of potential prairie dog habitat and restriction of area for colony expansion. USFWS (2004) concluded that present or threatened habitat destruction is not a threat to the species, although considerable effects due to this factor have occurred in the past. Additionally, USFWS concluded that present or threatened habitat modification as it relates to plague is not a significant threat to the species.CONTROL: Control by humans, interacting with low forage production, is probably the main cause of loss of the prairie dog from the more arid parts of its range, including southwest New Mexico and southeast Arizona (Cully 1992) and Texas (see map in Cheatheam 1977). For most of the 20th century, Animal Damage Control, its forerunners, and other control agencies worked hard to eliminate prairie dogs over wide areas (Cully 1992). Towns were poisoned primarily with strychnine and zinc-phosphide baits (e.g., oats mixed with rodenticide). Poisoning was immediately followed up with extermination of any remaining living prairie dogs (Cully 1992). Indeed, control efforts, with some help from plague, resulted in a reduction in prairie dog acreage from 700,000,000 to 1,500,000 in 1971 (Cain et al. 1971, in Fagerstone and Biggins 1986; Cully 1989). Today prairie dog poisoning efforts are limited to local, problem populations and entail control, not extermination. Public control agencies, including ADC, do very little prairie dog control work, as most control is practiced by land managers. These agencies do provide technical information and assistance, however.USFWS (2004) acknowledged extant and potentially significant local population reductions due to chemical control of prairie dogs but concluded that impacts due to this factor are not a threat to the extent that the species could become endangered in the foreseeable future.USFWS (2004) acknowledged that recreational shooting can reduce population densities at specific sites and that extirpation possibly may have occurred in isolated circumstances due to this factor. However, USFWS noted that populations can recover from very low numbers following intensive recreational shooting and therefore concluded that effects due to recreational shooting do not constitute a significant threat.Distribution, abundance, and trend data indicate that inadequate regulatory mechanisms are not limiting black-tailed prairie dog populations at present, nor are they likely to within the foreseeable future (USFWS 2004)."

    "threats_description": "While the threats to Grey Rhebok and their severity require more research, the primary threat is suspected to be increased levels of bushmeat and illegal sport hunting with dogs (Avenant 2013, Avenant et al. 2014, du Plessis et al. 2014). In KwaZulu-Natal alone, a recent survey of 92 people in rural settlements in the Wartburg, Estcourt and Creighton areas found that 82% of respondents hunt illegally (42% for meat and 46% hunted with dogs) on a regular basis, with 51% hunting every week (Grey-Ross et al. 2010). While Grey Rhebok was not explicitly mentioned as a target, we infer such hunting to affect this species. Protected areas close to urban areas exhibit increased predation by illegal sport hunting with packs of dogs and also feral dogs, such as in Bontebok National Park where recently eight Grey Rhebok were killed by dogs (C. Cowell unpubl. data). Similarly, the Cape Leopard Trust has raised serious concerns about the general decline of prey species and suspect that, due to the proximity of the Boland Mountains to the urban areas and expanding informal settlements, that the smaller antelope are targeted by snaring and hunted with dogs for bushmeat (C. Birss pers. comm. 2016). In Coleford Nature Reserve in the southern Drakensberg, where the Grey Rhebok subpopulation declined between 1986 and 2001, 79 dogs were removed from 1985\u20132002 and 96 snares were removed during 1990/91 alone (O\u2019Connor and Kr\u00fcger 2003). An initial subpopulation spike was coincident with the first removal of dogs from the reserve, which was probably symptomatic of escalated dog hunting in the adjacent properties and thus Grey Rhebok moving into Coleford Nature Reserve (O\u2019Connor and Kr\u00fcger 2003). In the Northern Cape, illegal hunting of Grey Rhebok by communal farmers is also a problem (C. Kraft pers. comm. 2016).Local declines are also suspected from increased densities of natural predators (Avenant 2013). Anecdotal reports from the Free State and Northern Cape suggest that an emerging threat is increased predation levels from higher abundances of mesopredators, especially Black-backed Jackal (Canis mesomelas) (Rowe-Rowe 1983b, C. Kraft and N. Avenant pers. obs. 2015), Caracals (Caracal caracal) (Palmer and Fairall 1988) and perhaps Leopard (Panthera pardus) in the arid areas (C. Kraft pers. comm. 2016). Poor carnivore management may be responsible for increased mesopredator abundance (Minnie et al. 2016).Habitat degradation may also play a role, such as climate-change or land-use induced bush encroachment (Hudak and Wessman 2001, Wigley et al. 2009) in areas such as the North West and Limpopo (Power 2014). There is no evidence for disease as a threat (Taylor et al. 2006), but Grey Rhebok may occasionally be affected by parasite infestation (Beukes 1988).It is likely that several threats synergise to cause subpopulation decline. For example, in Sterkfontein Dam Nature Reserve, Free State, the reasons behind declines are the observed increase in poaching (mainly hunting with dogs), increased predation rates due to the closure of the local vulture restaurant, and possibly habitat degradation related to increased frequency of fires (E. Schulze unpubl. data)."

    "threats_description": "Human-\u00adanimal interactions in agricultural and urban areas is an increasing threat to the species. Killing as pests, capture and release of macaques at sites far off (thereby affecting the group composition), and removal of trees for road expansions are all said to affect the distribution and abundance of these monkeys (Kumar et al. 2010). In Mysore, Singh et al. (2011) cite widening of highways as a threat. Feeding of monkeys is considered a big threat as it is suspected that commensal areas are sinks for groups and individuals are replaced constantly from an ever depleting resource of forest populations."

    "threats_description": "The major threat to this species at present is Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), compounded by roadkills, dog kills and persecution.Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD)Current evidence suggests that DFTD is an infectious, widespread disease (McCallum et al. 2007), so that any attempt to delineate boundaries between affected and unaffected locations is likely to be outdated swiftly. DFTD has been associated with local population declines of up to 89% since first reported (Hawkins et al. 2006, McCallum et al. 2007), indicated by long-term spotlighting data, widespread trapping and laboratory results. The declines, and the prevalence of the disease, have not eased off in any monitoring sites, and DFTD is present even in very low density areas. It is estimated that the adult population is approximately halving annually on the Freycinet peninsula (Lachish et al. 2007) with extinction predicted at this site 10-15 years after disease arrival (McCallum et al. 2007). Declines were most marked in areas where the disease had been reported earliest, in north-eastern and central eastern Tasmania.Mean spotlighting sightings of Tasmanian Devils per 10 km route, obtained from across the core Tasmanian Devil range (eastern and north-western Tasmania), have declined by 53% since the first report of DFTD-like symptoms in 1996 (McCallum et al. 2007). The most immediately threatened location is thought to be the region where DFTD was reported prior to 2003: across 15,000 km\u00b2 of eastern Tasmania. By 2005, the Devil Disease Project Team had confirmed DFTD in individuals found across 36,000 km\u00b2 of eastern and central Tasmania (Hawkins et al. 2006). DFTD is now confirmed across more than 60% of the devil's overall distribution (C. Hawkins unpubl.), and there is evidence for continued geographical spread of the disease (Hawkins et al. 2006), so that Tasmanian Devils across between 51% and 100% of Tasmania may be, or have already been, subject to &gt;90% declines in a ten-year period. The currently affected region covers the majority of the formerly high-density eastern management unit, involving what was perhaps around 80% of the total population.DTFD has resulted in the progressive loss of first the older adults from the population and then the younger adults (Lachish et al. 2007) so that populations are comprised of one and two year olds (Jones et al. in press, Lachish et al. submitted). As female devils usually breed for the first time at age two, they may not successfully raise a litter before they die of DFTD (Lachish et al. submitted). An increase in precocial breeding indicates some compensatory response, but as yet this appears to have been insufficient to counter mortality (Jones et al. in press, Lachish et al. submitted).DFTD behaves like a frequency-dependent disease, probably because the majority of the injurious biting, which is the type of contact most likely to lead to disease transmission, occurs between adults during the mating season (Hamede et al. in press). Frequency-dependent diseases, which are typically sexually transmitted, can lead to extinction (McCallum and Jones 2006). Because transmission occurs between the sexes at mating irrespective of population density, these types of diseases lack a threshold density below which they become extinct.Cannibalism is considered fairly common in Tasmanian Devils and renders the species particularly vulnerable to disease transmission (Pfennig et al. 1998; Jones et al. 2007). However, modes of transmission of DFTD are not as yet known.Road-killsA recent three-year study of roadkill frequency on the main roads of Tasmania estimated 2,205 Tasmanian Devils are killed on roads annually (Hobday and Minstrell submitted). This suggests that 2-3.% of the total Tasmanian Devil population are killed on roads (based on an estimated population of 60,000\u201390,000 individuals at the time of the survey). The roaded parts of Tasmania closely match the core distribution area for Tasmanian Devils.Roadkill was attributed as the cause of up to 50% and 20% of Tasmanian Devil death during a recording period of 17 months at Cradle Mountain and 12 months at Freycinet National Parks, respectively (Jones 2000; M. Jones pers. comm.). Local extinction and a similar rate of population decline at Cradle Mountain indicates that roadkill can cause local extinction, in which the road becomes a local sink (Jones 2000). Future impact is likely to remain at the same level.Dog killsReports of about 50 devils killed per year by poorly controlled dogs are served from about 20 dog owners. There is no obligation or incentive for such reports, and generally some hesitance even among those providing them, so the real figures are more likely of the order of several hundred devils killed by dogs each year.FoxesThere have been spasmodic, small-scale introductions of the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) into Tasmania since early European colonisation. Early incursions were sometimes efforts at acclimatisation and others for short-term hunting. More recently, there has been at least one accidental incursion (from a container ship in 1998) and credible reports of a concerted, malicious campaign of introduction. Hard evidence (confirmed scats, carcasses) of foxes has been found in the north-west and northern and southern midlands. Credible sighting reports have come from most of the eastern half of the State including the central highlands and the far north-west (Fox Free Tasmania 2006), mostly areas where Tasmanian Devil populations are suppressed by DFTD.A commonly held view has been that the abundance of Tasmanian Devils has prevented fox establishment through interference competition, either aggressive exclusion or predation on denned juveniles (Jones et al. 2007). Red Foxes and Tasmanian Devils share preferences for den sites and habitat, and are of a similar size. Tasmanian Devils abundance is likely to slow, if not prevent, fox establishment. It is possible that foxes have been present in Tasmania for many decades at sub-detectable levels, and that a degree of ecological release has occurred due to DFTD, with foxes increasing to detectable numbers. The current impact of the Red Fox has been quantified (N. Mooney pers. comm.), and it is unlikely that fox numbers are currently at a level to impose a measurable impact.A decline in Tasmanian Devils number may create a short to medium-term surplus of food, for example carrion; ideal for fox establishment. Fox establishment may cause both direct and indirect effects on Tasmanian Devils. Direct effects include (reciprocal) killing by then abundant foxes of then rare juvenile devils at dens while the female forages (Jones et al. 2007). Fox establishment may also cause ecosystem disruptions through changes in other species (Jones et al. 2007) - a feature of foxes on mainland Australia (e.g. Saunders et al. 1995) and something that might then also indirectly affect Tasmanian Devils. Tasmania has the potential to hold up to 250,000 foxes (based on modelling of habitat preferences and densities in south-east mainland Australian) which could replace most medium- to large-sized marsupial carnivores (N. Mooney unpubl.).PersecutionIn the past, persecution of the Tasmanian Devil has been very high throughout settled parts of Tasmania, and is thought to have brought about very low numbers at times. Through the 1980s and 1990s, systematic poisoning in many sheep-growing areas (particularly fine-wool with its reliance on merinos) was widespread and probably killed in excess of 5000 devils per year (N. Mooney unpubl., from interviews with landowners). In the 1990s, control permits were occasionally issued to individuals who were able to argue that Tasmanian Devils were pests (e.g. killing valuable lambs).Current persecution is much reduced, but can still be locally intense with in excess of 500 devils thought to be killed per year (N. Mooney pers. comm.). However, this is reducing since devil numbers have declined. While the small amount of current persecution is likely to persist it is unlikely to constitute a major threat unless the Tasmanian Devil population becomes extremely small and fragmented.Low genetic diversityJones et al. (2004) found the genetic diversity of Tasmanian Devils to be low relative to many Australian marsupials as well as placental carnivores. This was consistent with an island founder effect, but previous marked reductions in population size may also have played a role. Low genetic diversity can reduce population viability (Eldridge et al. 1999) and resistance to disease (Acevedo-Whitehouse et al. 2005)."

    "threats_description": "World demand for Bobcat fur rose gradually in the late 1960s and early 1970s and jumped in the mid-1970s after CITES entered into force, when the pelts of cats listed on Appendix I became legally unobtainable for the commercial fur trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Of particular and concern is the recent increase in Bobcat pelt prices from $85 in 2000, to record highs of $589 in 2013, $447 in 2014, and $305 in 2015, driven by high demand for fur in China, Europe, and Russia (Knudson 2016). The number of Bobcat pelts exported from the U.S. has quadrupled in recent years, climbing to a high of 65,000 in 2013 when pelt prices were highest. The US government has found that trade is not detrimental to Bobcat survival and is well-managed by state authorities. They have petitioned CITES numerous times, most recently in 2007, to remove the Bobcat from the CITES Appendices, arguing that the Bobcat does not meet the biological criteria for CITES listing and that their research indicates that importing governments should be able to reliably distinguish Bobcat skins from other species to prevent illegal trade (Govt of US 2007). However, the proposal was rejected by majority vote of the Parties to CITES (Nowell et al. 2007).Habitat loss is viewed as another primary threat to bobcats in all three range countries. Increasing urbanization results in direct habitat loss when human density is high, although Bobcats have proven to be fairly adaptive to urbanization (Ordenana et al. 2010, Tracey et al. 2013 ) and low density developments (one house per two acres), particularly in areas with landscaped green spaces and golf courses, and Bobcats have been documented denning and raising litters in human structures (Riley et al. 2010). However, as Bobcats adjust to human developed landscapes, indirect effects increase. Vehicle collisions can be a primary source of mortality in urban Bobcat populations (Riley et al. 2006) and in populations with a high proportion of transients (Blankenship et al. 2006). In addition, exposure to common rodenticides in urban landscapes can result in direct mortality (anticoagulant toxicosis) and increased susceptibility to severe notoedric mange resulting in the death of Bobcats (Riley 1999, Riley et al. 2003, Riley et al. 2006, Riley et al. 2007, Ruell et al. 2009, Serieys et al. 2013). Increases in urbanization and roads have also resulted in recent genetic isolation of Bobcats populations in several areas, indicating human developments are affecting historic dispersal patterns and gene flow, resulting in local and regional population structure (Riley et al. 2003, Croteau et al. 2012, Ruell et al. 2012, but see Millions and Swanson 2007). There is concern in the northeastern US about interspecific competition with expanding coyote populations (Moruzzi et al. 2002, Litvaitis and Harrison 1989, Litvaitis et al. 2006). However, in Florida, where Coyotes have also increased, Thornton et al. (2004) found that Bobcats and Coyotes favoured different prey species, with coyotes taking larger ungulates and Bobcats rodents and smaller mammals, and Coyotes and Bobcats coexist throughout most of the western portions of their ranges, likely through niche shifts in diet and activity (Fedriani et al. 2000). Bobcats coexist with Ocelots in Texas (Horne et al. 2009) and Canada Lynx in zones of sympatry (Peers et al. 2013) through habitat partitioning. Aside from exploitative competition, there is evidence of interference competition through intraspecific killing by Mountain Lions (Haas 2009) and hybridization has been detected with few federally threatened Canada Lynx (Lynx canadensis) in Maine, Minnesota, and New Brunswick (Homyack et al. 2008). In addition, increased or novel sources of depredation in have been documented in several areas. Bobcat observations in southern Florida have decreased dramatically as invasive python densities have increased (Dorcas et al. 2012). In Ventura County, California, Coyotes were found to be the leading source of Bobcat kitten mortality (Moriarty 2007), although this increase in predation pressure is likely a result of reduced avoidance options in highly fragmented urban habitat (Riley et al. 2003). Interactions with domestic dogs may also present threats to the Bobcat population. Canine distemper and canine distemper-associated encephalitis has been documented in Bobcats in eastern Canada (Daoust et al. 2009) validating the proposed role of dogs as a pathogen-mediated apparent competitor with Bobcats (Vanek and Gompper 2009), and several studies demonstrate negative correlation between domestic dog activity and Bobcat activity (George and Crooks 2006, Reed and Merenlender 2011). In localized areas Bobcats take domestic livestock and are persecuted as pests (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In addition, there have been recent concerns about the effects of harvest on local Bobcat populations in West Virginia (WV-DNR), and Michigan (Preuss and Gehring 2007) and poaching may result in higher harvest rates than anticipated in some areas (Millions and Swanson 2006), which can result in population declines as it has in New Hampshire (Litviatus et al. 2006). However, there is evidence from a survey of state game management agencies that Bobcat populations are stable or increasing, with densities greater than initially estimated, in all US states with the exception of Florida (Roberts and Crimmins 2010)."

Its habitat is subject to encroachment by increasing numbers of pastoralists and cutting of trees for firewood and charcoal. Civil conflicts, wars and unrest have affected much of the range in Somalia and the Ogaden over recent decades. If current trends continue, it may eventually disappear from large parts of its present distribution until it is largely restricted to effectively protected and managed areas of suitable habitat. Such areas currently comprise only a small part of its remaining range. The largest protected population, in Tsavo National Park, has been reduced by rinderpest and drought (East 1999). Agricultural expansion, for example in the southern Masai steppe is encroaching on their habitat, but most of Gerenuk's range is too arid to support agriculture (Foley et al. 2014)."

However, the bushmeat trade in African savannas may pose a genuine threat to Aardvark populations in some countries (e.g. Zambia, Mozambique). Localized threats include habitat loss due to agriculture and subsistence hunting. Hatt (1934) recorded indigenous hunters in the Congo killing Aardvarks trapped in burrows, and Mbuti pygmies in the Ituri Forest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo smoke them out of their burrows (Carpaneto and Germi 1989). The meat is prized, while other parts of the Aardvark, such as the skin, claws and teeth, are used to make bracelets, charms and curios, and for some medicinal purposes (Carpaneto and Germi 1989). In western Kenya (1960s), local hunters flooded burrows to kill animals for food (Rathbun 2011)."

    "threats_description": "There are no major threats to this species across its range, although in parts of its range it may be at risk from more localised threats. On the Iberian Peninsula, incidental and deliberate poisoning (e.g. by rodenticides) is a localised threat (F. Carvalho pers. comm. 2016). In Portugal stand hunting and hunting with dogs (flushing and inside burrows) are legal and can be practiced from October to February (F. Carvalho pers. comm. 2016). In addition, hunters may ask and obtain an exceptional authorization to trap and kill Egyptian mongooses between March and May (F. Carvalho pers. comm. 2016). In Spain, H. ichneumon is considered a pest by hunters, because of its presumed impact on small game species (Delibes 1999). In North Africa, this species is often protected by local people because it is valued as a predator of snakes (F. Cuzin and K. de Smet pers. comm. 2007)."

    "threats_description": "Currently, the predominant threat to the species on the mainland is reduction in stream and river flows due to recent successive droughts, stream regulation, and extraction of water for agricultural, domestic, and industrial supplies. It is also at risk from the opposite extremes associated with climate change \u2013 extensive flooding both in space and time associated with recent tropical cyclones that have resulted in increased mortality and all but eliminated recruitment in 2006 over a substantial part of the species\u2019 northern range. Habitat modification due to bank erosion and stream sedimentation (as a result of poor land management practices in agriculture, forestry, and urbanization) are also of great concern. In the case of urban streams, Platypus populations may be adversely affected by poor water quality (in the form of suspended solids and nutrient enrichment), contamination of sediment by heavy metals (Serena and Pettigrove 2005) and entanglement in or ingestion of plastic, rubber and metal litter. Accidental drowning in nets and traps set for fish and crustaceans has the potential to impact Platypus distribution and abundance in all parts of its range, especially in small streams where populations may be critically small. Populations in Tasmania are affected by mucormycosis (associated with the fungal pathogen Mucor amphibiorum) (Obendorf et al. 1993). Across its range, the Platypus is also subject to predation by the introduced Red Fox, dogs and cats."

They are persecuted across their range by retaliatory hunting due to livestock depredation, and due to fear that they pose a threat to human life (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007). Pumas have killed a number of people in western Canada and the US in recent years. Pumas are legally hunted in many western US states, although hunting was banned by popular referendum in California in 1990. Road kills are the principal cause of mortality in the endangered Florida Panther subpopulation, and heavily travelled roads are a major barrier to Puma movements and dispersal (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002)."

    "threats_description": "Potential threats to Pine Marten include unsustainable hunting and trapping, incidental poisoning, and the loss and fragmentation of woodland habitats. This marten is hunted and trapped for its fur in some parts of its range. Its decline in Britain was because of persecution as a predator of livestock and, particularly, of game, and the species is still subject to persecution even in some countries in which it is protected. Efforts to control other carnivore species sometimes result in Pine Marten deaths."

    "threats_description": "Black-tailed Jackrabbits are not at risk from hunting for sport and local subsistence, but the effects of human perturbation and exotic predation are unknown. In some places competition with livestock, habitat fragmentation and human-induced fire represent important threats to populations. Declining habitat quality and climate change may also be affecting populations. Decreasing control of Coyotes (Canis latrans), Bobcats (Lynx rufus), and other predators has led to an increase in predation on this species.The Magdalena Island Black-tailed Jackrabbit (L. c. magdalenae) shares its habitat with predators such as Coyotes (Canis latrans peninsulae) with an average population density estimated of 0.73 individuals/km\u00b2 and a number estimated of 230 individuals on the island, which may be negatively affecting the endemic populations of this subspecies. On the Margarita Island, Goats (Capra aegagrus) and several Feral Cats and their traces (footprints and excreta, Felis sylvestris) were obsered in the habitat of L. c. magdalenae, as well as also nests of Osprey (Pandion haliaetus). The high density of Feral Cats represents competing exotic fauna that can affect the endemic populations of the jackrabbits on the island (Lorenzo et al. 2014, 2018).The Carmen Island Black-tailed Jackrabbit (L. c. sheldoni) also shares its range with a high density of Feral Cats, which may be affecting the population of the island's endemic subspecies (Lorenzo et al. 2014, 2018)."

    "threats_description": "Bohor Reedbuck have been eliminated from large parts of their natural range by overhunting and loss of habitat to the expansion of settlement and livestock, although it tends to survive for longer in over-exploited areas than less secretive and more easily hunted species. In many countries it only survives in viable but greatly depleted numbers in protected areas. Drought has also been cited as a major threat. In North Cameroon, floodplain degradation through the construction of upstream dams has been a major reason for the decline of Reedbuck; nonetheless, reedbuck can still be observed even in floodplain areas with (relatively) high population pressure (P. Scholte, in Hoffmann and Kingdon 2013)."

Their habitat is of little value to humans and it persists outside protected areas in regions where subsistence hunting pressure is not intense. The Klipspringer\u2019s adaptation to the inaccessible hillsides and cliffs in these areas enables it to avoid most competition from domestic herds. Small, isolated populations within relatively small areas of rocky habitat are more vulnerable to hunting and competition from goats, and many of these populations have been eliminated in settled regions."

    "threats_description": "Florida populations declined by about 50% from some 400,000 adult females in the 1950s (Rice 1957) to less than 200,000 females in 1991 (Gore and Hovis 1992). Not only did numbers of bats decline, but number of caves used as maternity roosts also declined by nearly 50% (from 15 to 18) in Florida over the same period. There is no indication that the population has stabilized. Some caves occupied in the early 1980s are no longer occupied (Gore and Hovis 1992). However, Brown (1997) reported that this species is adaptable and seems to be holding its own in the southeastern United States. While the Florida population was thriving in the 1960s, Barbour and Davis (1969) reported that the Ohio River Valley population was steadily declining and apparently nearing extirpation. Current data from this northern range indicates that populations are still present in low numbers, although their status remains largely unknown. Indiana populations had declined considerably by 1980 (Mumford and Whitaker 1982), although populations were always small. Recent extensive searches in Illinois indicated that the population has become more restricted than in the past; only one hibernating colony was located, compared to nine previously known hibernating sites, and the bats were only found in four counties compared to six in the past. Georgia has 12 older records (before 1970), and only one record since 1970, but this change could be due to lack of searching. Recent field studies in coastal North Carolina, South Carolina, and eastern Texas have located populations of this species, but there are no baseline data with which to compare trends. Declines likely have resulted from various factors, especially human disturbance and physical alteration of caves used as hibernacula and maternity sites (Gore and Hovis 1992). Excessive human visitation may awaken bats and cause them to use up fat reserves. In maternity colonies, disturbance may cause females to abandon their young. Heavy collecting or banding may cause a population to vacate a site. Attempts to collect, even in winter, usually result in bats vacating at least temporarily (Mumford and Whitaker 1982). In addition, some caves have been made unavailable or degraded by the closing off of their entrances, installation of bat-impermeable barriers, forest removal around entrances, or by flooding by reservoirs. Loss of upland roosts increases vulnerability to mortality from sudden flooding. One cave formerly used by 11,000 individuals was turned into a public dump and virtually abandoned by bats. Clearing and draining of bottonland hardwood forest wetlands likely have reduced available habitat for summer roosting and foraging. The indirect effects of pesticide use are unknown."

Similarly, Namibian farmers responding to a government questionnaire reported killing up to 2,800 Caracals in 1981 (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Brand (1989) found that Caracals were responsible for the loss of up to 5.3 domestic stock per 100 km\u00b2 per annum in the former Cape Province of South Africa. Severity of depredation appears to be dependent on the availability of wild prey and husbandry techniques (Stuart and Stuart 2013).Habitat destruction (agriculture and desertification) is a significant threat in central, west, north and northeast Africa where Caracals are naturally sparsely distributed (Ray et al. 2005). It is also likely to be the main threat in the Asian part of its range (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).On the Arabian Peninsula, habitat loss and fragmentation due to road and settlement expansion are major threats (Mallon and Budd 2011). However, also retaliation killing due to livestock predation is a threat (Mallon and Budd 2011). Additionally, prey base declines could negatively affect the Caracal too (Mallon and Budd 2011). In the United Arab Emirates, Caracals are found in the international pet trade. However, the source of these animals and the impact of this trade on the population are unknown (Mallon and Budd 2011).In parts of Turkey, people dislike the species and persecute it because they think it predates on small stock animals (Albayrak et al. 2012). Around Termessos National Park Caracals also get killed in road accidents (Albayrak et al. 2012).In Iran, major threats are attacks by herd dogs and road kills (Ghoddousi et al. 2009). In Afghanistan, hunting pressure and habitat loss due to the extension of agriculture are major threats causing population decline (Habibi 2004). In India, habitat loss and fragmentation and increased human disturbance are the main threats to the Caracal (Kolipaka 2011)."

    "threats_description": "Mephitis mephitis is vulnerable to a variety of mortality agents such as predation, disease, environmental conditions (e.g., severe winter or drought), chemicals, and anthropogenic activities (Rosatte and Larivi\u00e8re 2003, Hansen et al. 2004, Gehrt 2005). Another limiting factor on skunk populations is diseases such as rabies and the resultant control programmes (Sikes 1970). Terrestrial rabies apparently was the case for skunks in Illinois, where population fluctuations are closely tied to rabies outbreaks (Verts 1967). Striped Skunk pelts were considered valuable commodities in the fur trade in the first half of the 20th century, but their value and the number of skunks harvested for fur declined dramatically in the 1950s and 1960s as fashions shifted away from long-haired furs (Verts 1967). Striped Skunks may be harvested in most areas of the United States and Canada. In some states, such as Florida, skunks may be taken only in season, but most states allow harvests year-round (Rosatte 1987)."

    "threats_description": "The main threat to this species is habitat destruction due to the expansion of and human settlements and intensive agricultural production (sensu Rouget et al. 2003). While intensive agricultural production may reduce available habitat they can exist in agricultural landscapes, sometimes in high numbers if the area remains unworked for a couple of years. For example, all animals sampled in Visser et al. (2014) study were from agricultural areas that displayed no inbreeding and had demographically stable populations. Additionally, they are commonly killed on roads while dispersing above ground. Males sometimes range longer distances than usual in search of a mate, and Mole-rats are also forced above ground when seasonal flooding takes place. In some parts of its range this species is classified as a pest, resulting in pest control procedures. Climate change is unlikely to have an impact on this species as geology and drainage evolution has a larger influence on its distribution than does climate."

War and civil unrest especially in Central Africa over the last 30 years has had \u2013 and continues to have \u2013 a negative effect. Buffalo are susceptible to drought, which has caused substantial declines in some populations in the Sahel at the end of the 1960s and during the 1990s in Tsavo, Serengeti/Mara, Gonarezhou and Kruger also strongly impacted buffalo populations (East 1999, Corn\u00e9lis et al. 2014).African Buffalo are susceptible to a range of indigenous and imported infectious diseases. In the past, numbers of African Buffalo suffered their most severe collapse during the great rinderpest epidemic of the 1890s, which, coupled with pleuro-pneumonia, caused mortalities as high as 95% among livestock and wild ungulates (Winterbach 1998). Rinderpest was declared eradicated in Africa in 2011 (Morens et al. 2011)."

    "threats_description": "The species is threatened by multiple human activities throughout its range, destruction of riparian habitat, overfishing, contamination of water bodies\u2014especially by gold mining, fossil fuel exploration, and the use of pesticides and fertilizers, diseases spread by domestic animals, and mismanaged tourism (Duplaix 1980, Schenck 1999, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Human populations are increasing and expanding. In the last census, the Amazon region registered the highest population growth in Brazil. Illegal settlements, road opening and deforestation threaten pristine habitats. Colonization of new areas are expected, followed by intensive exploitation of natural resources. Furthermore, proposed mega-projects in the 2007 Brazilian Growth Acceleration Plan represent a significant threat to Brazilian Amazonian and Pantanal habitats. Changes in government and environmental protection policies in Brazil endanger the pristine areas of the Amazon, Pantanal and Cerrado. Between 2017 and 2019 4,500 km\u00b2 of the Amazon were lost due to deforestation and burning, of which 65% occurred in 2019 (Cannon 2019, https://news.mongabay.com/2019/11/deforestation-preceded-fires-in-massive-area-of-amazon-in-2019/). From August to November of 2019, at least 1.5 million hectares of Brazilian Pantanal were burned (https://www.dw.com/en/brazils-next-fire-disaster-in-the-pantanal-wetlands/a-51199164). Hunting for the pelt trade was the greatest threat to the Giant Otter in the past and the species came close to extinction in the early 1970s in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazilian Pantanal (Duplaix 1980). From 1960 to 1969, records indicated a regional harvest of 12,390 giant otter skins. In 1973, giant otters were placed on CITES Appendix I, and the enforcement of international trade restrictions on Giant Otter skins in 1975 finally ended Giant Otter hunting (Recharte and Bodmer 2010). The Giant Otter remains endangered because of the low recuperation rate of relict populations now also under pressure from human activities (Groenendijk et al. 2015). Direct conflict between humans and otters is an increasing problem. Otters may be killed for fun or out of fear, or, more often, because they are seen as competitors for fish by loggers, miners, and fishermen, who often blame them for depleting fish resources used for local and commercial consumption (G\u00f3mez and Jorgensen 1999, Recharte et al. 2008, Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2012, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Giant Otters can drown in fishing nets and traps and are also blamed for damaging them (Rosas-Ribeiro et al. 2012, Utreras et al. 2013). Fish farming is rapidly increasing in the species\u2019 range, for example in parts of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and expose otters to retaliation killing (V. Utreras pers. obs.). Cubs are sometimes captured illegally to be kept as pets (M. Marmontel pers. obs). Giant Otters are highly susceptible to persecution: they are large, conspicuous, social, and very vocal. They are active at daytime and occupy open habitats and stable territories. Their signs\u2014latrines and dens\u2014are easily recognizable, making it possible to identify areas of recent activity by a group (Groenendijk et al. 2005). Individuals and groups often react to people by approaching to investigate. Moreover, only the dominant pair produces young, and usually only once a year. During the pelt trade years, these life history attributes made them an easy target for fishermen. In 2017, a Giant Otter group was killed by fishermen in the Pantanal and according to locals, kills occur frequently during the fishing season (C. Leuchtenberger pers. obs.). In 2011\u20132012, the Kanamari indigenous people promoted a massive Giant Otter killing in their territory (Territ\u00f3rio Ind\u00edgena Kanamari), based on their perception that the species was overfishing the river turtle population. The community leader bought 300 cartridges for the hunters, who shot 64 Giant Otters (Endo pers. comm. 2012). Such incidents of targeted killing can lead to extinction of small populations in a watershed. Gold mining, artisanal as well as industrial, is a significant threat to the species, particularly in the Guiana Shield region, in southeastern Peru, the western region of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and northern Pantanal. The main impacts are habitat destruction, sedimentation of rivers, and pollution (Kimbrough 2014). Gold miners cut swathes into the floodplain forest and blast river banks with pressure hoses, using mercury to amalgamate gold particles. Gold prices are at a record high, whereas mercury is inexpensive. Forest conversion to mining increased six-fold from 2003\u20132006 to 2006\u20132009 (Swenson et al. 2011). Even a decade after mining stopped, areas affected still had depleted fish populations and had not been re-colonized by otters. In areas of gold mining, fish are contaminated with mercury. Gutleb et al. (1997) found that mercury concentrations in the majority of fish near Manu National Park were higher than considered tolerable for the Eurasian otter. Migration of contaminated fish and long-range atmospheric transport of mercury probably increase the area of influence of such contaminants. Contamination of otters by other heavy metals through pesticides and other agrochemicals is still poorly understood. The many planned hydroelectric dams in the species\u2019 range are a major threat to Giant Otters. These will alter hydrological regimes of rivers and affect fish populations and habitat (Latrubesse et al. 2017). Dams disrupt the annual cycles of inundations, vital for the maintenance of populations of flood dependent species such as the Giant Otter (Mour\u00e3o et al. 2010, Alho and Sabino 2011). One hundred and eighty-four new dams are planned or under construction, greater than two MW capacity over the next 20 years in the Amazon. These dams would include five of the six major Andean tributaries of the Amazon. Sixty per cent of the dams would cause the first major break in connectivity between protected Andean headwaters and the lowland Amazon. Giant Otters are able to live in some artificial lakes, such as the shallow Balbina Reservoir in Brazil (Rosas et al. 2007). In other areas, hydroelectric dams have depleted Giant Otter populations, as did the Curu\u00e1-Una Hydroelectric in the Brazilian Amazonia (Rosas et al. 2007). Around the Pantanal, there are over 115 projects of small hydroelectric plants. Other major infrastructure projects include the Inter-oceanic highway in southeastern Peru, and the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America (V. Utreras pers. comm. 2012). Giant Otters are vulnerable to disturbance from poorly managed tourism, including sport fishing. It is important to control increasing levels of tourism on lakes and rivers both in and outside protected areas (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Research has shown that Giant Otter reproductive success and sighting success by tourists is considerably lower on unmanaged lakes than on managed lakes (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Giant Otter cubs held in captivity have died of canine parvovirus, and all mustelids are susceptible to canine distemper, so domestic animal diseases may pose a serious threat to wild Giant Otter populations. Infection can also occur in remote areas, since transient otters and people hunting with dogs travel large distances with potential for contact and infection of vulnerable otter populations (Schenck et al. 1999). Climatic changes are predicted to increase suitable areas for Giant Otters (Cianfrani et al. 2018). However, long-term habitat and climatic modifications will increase the exposure of suitable core otter areas to the negative effects of the surrounding unsuitable areas (Cianfrani et al. 2018). The species also has a high specialized niche, making it more vulnerable to climate change."

    "threats_description": "The Ringtail is legally trapped for fur in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Texas (USA), where it is also caught incidentally in traps set for valuable fur-bearers such as foxes (Canidae) and raccoons Procyon. In recent years about 4,000 have been taken annually in Arizona, and about 1,000 in New Mexico. In Texas 45,000~50,000 Ringtails were trapped each year from 1979 to 1985. As with raccoons, the number of Ringtails trapped for fur has declined since a peak in 1979, when approximately 135,000 pelts were sold. Ringtail fur is of poor quality (thin, non-durable, and subject to fading), and pelts have usually sold for less than US$5 each although they have brought as much as US$12. The justification for trapping Ringtails for fur is weak, especially because in none of the states where trapping is legal is there sufficient knowledge of population levels and trends on which to base valid harvest regulations (Glatston 1994). Threats to the Ringtail include also automobiles (Glatston 1994)."

    "threats_description": "This species is locally threatened by habitat loss and degradation. Contributing factors include the construction of dams and the influence of introduced predators. Damming along the Agua Fria River in particular has reduced the extent of preferred breeding habitat available to this species (Green et al. 2014). Drought associated with climate change is also thought to pose a threat, as it is likely to detrimentally affect this species' habitat in the future (NatureServe 2020).Hybridization with Anayrus woodhousii also poses a potential threat, although it currently does not seem to be making a significant impact on the overall population (Schwaner and Sullivan 2009). Outside of New Mexico, hybrids of A. microscaphus and A. woodhousii occur at virtually all localities near dams and reservoirs where the two species co-exist, and this has led to population declines of A. microscaphus in Arizona and Utah following dam construction which facilitated the spread of A. woodhousii (Blair 1955, Sullivan and Lamb 1988, Sullivan et al. 2015, Ryan et al. 2017). Within New Mexico, however, hybridization does not appear to have occurred (Ryan et al. 2017). This species has tested positive for the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), with both positive specimens sampled from within the Gila National Forest which encompasses much of the range of A. microscaphus in New Mexico. At this time it is unclear the degree of threat that Bd poses to the species (Ryan et al. 2014), although there is evidence that A. microscaphus has experienced declines and local population extirpations in New Mexico from currently unidentified factors (Ryan et al. unpubl. report, Ryan et al. 2017)."

    "threats_description": "Causes of declines for this species need further study including factors that continue to place the species at risk. Likely threats are those that increase meadow degradation leading to reductions in the amount and hydroperiods of shallow water breeding habitats (USFWS 2014). Threats to adults and subadults in upland habitats need further study. The disease, chytridiomycosis, may play a role in the species decline (Dodge 2013, Lindauer et al. 2019). In their listing of the species as federally threatened, USFWS identified livestock grazing and fire management regimes as moderate threats, and roads, timber harvest, dams and water diversions, and recreational activities and land use as low-level threats (USFWS 2014). These activities have the potential to impact meadow hydrology resulting in habitat loss for the species (USFWS 2014), as well as other potential direct and indirect effects to the species. High mortality from road kill recently has been documented at several breeding meadows, increasing awareness of this threat (S. Barnes pers. comm., R. van Horne pers. comm. ). Increasing number of Common Ravens, often associated with increased recreation, could also pose a threat to this species (Green et al. 2014). The temporal pattern of the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) emergence was coincident with historical declines of the species in a retrospective study of museum specimens (Dodge 2013). This same study found Bd to be currently widely distributed across the species range at low prevalence and low infection intensity. Juveniles have been found to be highly susceptible to Bd infection (Lindauer and Voyles 2019). Some subpopulations in Yosemite National Park have persisted with chytrid being present in a high proportion of individuals (Fellers et al. 2011, Fellers et al. 2015). Climate change is considered to pose a major threat to this species, because of the anticipated hydrologic effects and changes in temperature regimes. As this species depends on very shallow ephemeral water to reproduce, their reproduction success is vulnerable to dry winters and reduced snowpack that both reduce the amount of breeding habitat and cause early desiccation of breeding sites. Anayyrus canorus is adapted to its highly variable and stochastic montane environment, but aspects of its life history also make it vulnerable (Brown et al. 2019, Sadinski et al. 2020). For example, placement of eggs in very shallow water facilitates fast development, yet also makes them vulnerable to desiccation and overnight freezing. Ephemeral breeding habitats also place tadpoles at risk when sites dry before they metamorphose. There can be high mortality of eggs and tadpoles naturally (Brown et al. 2020, Sadisnki et al. 2020). These relationships can be complex. The synergistic effects of annual weather conditions and the presence of a water mould (Saprolegnia diclina) and a predatory species of flatworm (Turbellaria sp.) were the primary factors responsible for embryo mortality observed in a 1996\u20132001 study by Sadinksi et al. (2020). Finally, minor impacts to meadow hydrology may result in large changes to the very shallow breeding habitats. These vulnerabilities may be exacerbated in impacted habitats. Projected climate dynamics may also increase risk to the species, due to anticipated longer droughts and extraordinary precipitation events (Sadinski et al. 2020)."

    "threats_description": "Past declines and disappearances in some areas were, at least in part, related to deforestation from urban development, agriculture and water pollution, which is ongoing throughout the species' range. In addition, chytrid infection has been confirmed for this species (Puschendorf et al. 2006). Larvae can take several years to fully mature and may serve as a long-term reservoir of infection to sympatric species with quicker generation times and higher susceptibilities. The subpopulation in Parque Nacional Cusuco in Honduras has fluctuated significantly since 2004, at one point nearing extirpation. The reason for this apparent population crash and subsequent rebound is enigmatic, as it occurred within a protected forest with minimal habitat disturbance. Subsequent surveys indicated a high prevalence of chytrid infection in this population in 2007, but whether chytridiomycosis played a role in previous declines remains unknown and it is likely that additional factors were involved (J.E. Kolby pers. comm. 2008). Wild individuals of this species from Nicaragua have tested positive for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), although further studies are required to understand the impact of chytridiomycosis on subpopulations there (Garc\u00eda-Roa et al. 2014)."

    "threats_description": "The species is presumed to be subject to no major threats across the range as a whole, although human impacts are increasingly affecting some subpopulations (Z. Ortega Diago pers. comm. 2020) such as the Molouya River Basin in Morocco (Mabrouki 2019). These are under pressure from the over-exploitation of water resources, water pollution (both agricultural and industrial - Mabrouki 2019), fragmentation of subpopulations, urban expansion and climate change (Samraoui et al. 2012, Amor et al. 2013, Bellakhal et al. 2014b). High rates of morphological abnormalities (more than 35% of new metamorphs and young juveniles) have been recorded in waterbodies in areas subject to intensive agriculture (Ben Hassine et al. 2011). It is likely that these malformations result in elevated mortality in affected subpopulations, and may represent a major threat in some areas (Ben Hassine et al. 2011). There has been some loss of habitat around Ceuta and Melilla. Subpopulations in the southern part of the distribution are most threatened by water scarcity resulting from drainage (including that of a major wetland complex in northern Algeria important for regional amphibian conservation - Samraoui et al. 2012) and habitat alteration, and reduction in habitat suitability (including the impacts of increased temperature on larval development) and an increase in the incidence of fire resulting from climate change (Samraoui et al. 2012. Mateo et al. 2013, Bellakbal et al. 2014b). Water cisterns in arid areas represent population sinks, where animals breed but the young cannot escape (L. Garc\u00eda-Cardenete pers. comm. 2020). The species has been found to co-exist with invasive fish (Samraoui et al. 2012), and in desert oases the frogs have been observed to feed on exotic mosquitofish (Garc\u00eda-Cardenete et al. 2011). Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been found in Morocco, and this species is believed to be susceptible to the disease chytridiomycosis (El Cadi et al. 2019). This species may itself be a threat when locally introduced to ponds in Europe, through both competitive exclusion and hybridization, should these exotic populations become established in the wild (Kopeck\u00fd et al. 2016)."

    "threats_description": "There are no known significant threats to its global population. It uses some cultivated areas successfully, but extensive-intensive farming eliminates or reduces local sub-populations. It experiences mortality as a result of road traffic, especially when roads are in close proximity to wetlands (COSEWIC 2010). Breeding sites are typically the result of heavy rains and hence not generally subject to loss via water projects. In fact, this toad often breeds in reservoir edges. Suburban sprawl has eliminated breeding and non-breeding habitats in areas adjacent to growing cities in Colorado (Hammerson 1999). In Mexico it can be threatened by land use change due to urbanization (G. Santos-Barrera pers. comm. Red List Workshop, June 2014)."

Mortality of the species through disease (iridovirus) has been recorded in Carris Lake, Peneda-Ger\u00eas National Park, Portugal. The disease might be non-native and have been transferred to the lake by an introduced predatory fish (Lepomis gibbosus). Predation by L. gibbosus and other introduced predatory fish species occurs but is probably not a threat, and it is not greatly threatened in Portugal by the expansion of non-native predatory crayfish (Beja pers. comm.). In France, it is being displaced within some of its range by the introduced species Pelophylax ridibundus."

While Bd can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, Bsal has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel et al. 2013). Bd has spread globally, but at present Bsal is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel et al. 2014, Nguyen et al. 2017). Currently in Europe, Bsal has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g., Thein et al. 2020) and Spain (Martel et al. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel et al. 2014). Laboratory trials for susceptibility to Bsal demonstrate that Salamandrina perspicillata is susceptible to the disease. Only juveniles have been tested, but 100% mortality was observed (F. Pasmans and A. Martel pers. comm. June 2021). While Bsal is not present in this species' range yet, there is a risk from nearby outbreaks, with the nearest outbreak occurring 743 km away. Based on current distribution data for Bsal, it is expected that the natural advancement of the infection could be up to 10 km per year which would result in a conservative advancement of 400\u2013500 km per 50 years. Extinction risk modelling demonstrates that this species will be at significant risk from the natural spread of the fungus in the next 75 years. However, this does not take into account human introduction of the disease, and should a new outbreak occur within or nearer to this species\u2019 range then it will need to be reassessed as soon as possible."

    "threats_description": "The species is locally threatened by general drainage, pollution and eutrophication of breeding pools, abandonment of traditional farming practices and the introduction of predatory fishes and crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) (and possibly non-native vegetation). Alien fish introduction leads to forgoing aquatic life and thus decrease of reproduction (Winandy et al. 2015). Desertification is a threat in southern parts of the range, and climate change/fluctuation is a general threat to reproductive success and population stability (Galloy and Deno\u00ebl 2010, Meek, 2021). Road kills present another significant threat for this species (Meek 2012), and rural road networks act as barriers to gene flow for this species (Garcia-Gonzalez et al. 2012). Dermocystic infections have also been recorded in this species in several places (Gonzales-Hernandez et al. 2010, Courtois et al. 2013, Gal\u00e1n and Dopereiro 2017, Mart\u00ednez-Silvestre et al. 2017), as well as triple co-infections (Ayres et al. 2020), which could erode population stability in the long-term. Individuals have also tested positive for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) (Lastra Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2019), but it is unknown to what extent this is a threat to this species. Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to B. dendrobatidis (Bd), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world.

    "threats_description": "This species is threatened by habitat alteration and fragmentation, as well as the introduction of non-native predatory and competitive fishes, crayfishes, and frogs (Jennings and Hayes 1994, Sredl et al. 1997). Agricultural practices, livestock grazing, urban development and reservoir construction all contribute to habitat loss and degradation across this species' range (Jennings and Hayes 1994). Damming, draining, and water diversion projects have all resulted in the fragmentation of formerly contiguous aquatic habitats, and in many areas this fragmentation has been further accentuated by the introduction of predatory fishes, crayfish, and bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus). In many areas along the Colorado and Gila rivers in Arizona, Lithobates yavapaiensis has been replaced by L. catesbeianus (Clarkson and Rorabaugh 1989). The synergistic effects of these factors has resulted in the blockage of potential dispersal corridors for recolonization.This species is also vulnerable to large-scale mortality on a frequent basis due to drought, disease, and sulphur toxicity (Sredl et al. 1997, Green et al. 2014). With regard to disease, high prevalence of the pathogenic amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has been detected in Arizonan subpopulations, particularly during cooler seasons (Schlaepfer et al. 2007). This pathogen appears to cause winter mortalities from chytridiomycosis in some subpopulations of the species, with potential negative effects on subpopulation persistence (Savage et al. 2011)."

    "threats_description": "Hunting and habitat loss occur at high levels almost throughout this species' range. While it is clear that the genus remains widespread and common in its Sundaic range in the face of these threats, few data to support assessment specifically of Lesser Chevrotain\u2019s current status were traced: many key studies there have not identified chevrotains to species. In the non-Sundaic areas, evaluation of resilience is hampered by evident heterogeneity of chevrotain occurrence with a lack of convergence of opinion as to explanations of some.North of the sympatry with T. napu, T kanchil is heavily hunted and is often considered one of the most preferred wild meats (Srikosmatara et al. 1992, Duckworth et al. 1999, Kuznetzov and Borissenko 2004, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2006, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Nonetheless, it is clear that T. kanchil is adept at surviving in areas (at least in the lowland plains) in the face of very heavy hunting, major habitat degradation and isolation from other forest areas. Exemplifying this, it was one of the few mammals larger than a rat confirmed to persist at Houay Nhang, an isolate of a few km\u00b2 of highly degraded forest just outside the capital of Vientiane facing, in the early 1990s, exceedingly concentrated hunting with guns and snares (Duckworth et al. 1994). A little to the west it persists in Sangthong district, which was heavily logged just before a 1996 survey and also supported heavy hunting (Duckworth 1996). These two areas are within 10 and 70 km, respectively, of, and ecologically contiguous with, Thangon, from where Osgood (1932) reported specimens of T. kanchil (confirmed by E. Meijaard pers. comm. 2008 as this species), and thus the modern records probably do relate to T. kanchil. Hansel (2004) provided a further record from the adjacent low hills. Numbers of chevrotains in Vientiane markets in the early 1990s (Srikosamatara et al. 1992) were so high that they could not be at the brink of extinction in this degraded and fragmented landscape. Chevrotains are still common in trade in the city, although mostly in transit rather than on open sale in the city\u2019s markets, and their origin is not clear (T. Hansel pers. comm. 2008). The genus was recently camera-trapped quite commonly in a part of Nakai\u2013Nam Theun NPA where ground mammals were much depleted (Johnson and Johnston 2007), perhaps indicating higher resilience than many other mammals, although there is no information to compare with pre-exploitation levels. While non-Sundaic chevrotains can, therefore, clearly persist under extreme pressures in at least some circumstances, this does not rule out that densities might be quickly reduced through the twin pressures of hunting and habitat degradation. Decreasing population densities between the 1970s and 1990s, in at least parts of southern Viet Nam, were suggested by both spot-lighting surveys and qualitative assessments of footprints. Near Buon Luoi in December 1978, chevrotains were spotlit at about three animals per 5 km of transect route, but by 1993, when forest had undergone heavy degradation and hunting was very heavy, chevrotains were not even found every night with at least 10 km of transect (Kuznetzov and Borissenko 2004). Kuznetzov and Borissenko (2004) proposed that night-time hunting may explain chevrotain\u2019s near-absence from habitats with open-understory (this feature allowing chevrotains to be readily hunted using spotlights and guns) in the Buon Luoi area, because by contrast in Cat Tien National Park, where the use of firearms has been banned for decades and enforcement is fairly effective, chevrotains are encountered with comparable frequency both in thickets and on exposed forest floor (Borissenko and Ivanova 2003). This sighting rates contrast is consistent with a difference between the headquarters area of Khao Yai National Park, Thailand (where chevrotains are readily found by spotlight) and which is relatively well-protected from hunting, and Lao forests (see above) where hunting was effectively unrestrained (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). However, a proposal that, where hunting is unrestrained, as it is in most of Viet Nam and Lao PDR, chevrotains would be common in heavy forest but have been effectively eradicated from such habitat, is flawed for at least Lao PDR, where numbers of forest mammals killed through spotlight hunting are probably insignificant compared with those trapped (including with snares) and perhaps even killed using dogs (J.W. Duckworth and R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, based on numbers of active hunters encountered at nigh versus traps found, in many areas of Lao PDR). Kuznetzov and Borissenko (2004) based their reasoning on only two sites and it is possible that other factors explain the differences. In sum, the effects of hunting and habitat modification, and the interaction between them, on non-Sundaic chevrotains remain most unclear.The effects of potential threats operating in the Sundaic range are not understood well, either. Lesser Oriental Chevrotain is now rather rare on Singapore (K. Lim pers. comm. 2008), presumably nowadays constrained by habitat quality rather than by ongoing hunting, although the role of free-ranging dogs, if any, in restraining population numbers is unclear. However, the \u2018island within an island\u2019 situation of remaining forest on Singapore and the extreme habitat loss over the last 150 years prevent useful extrapolation of this species' situation there to other Sundaic areas. Poaching pressure in Kerinci-Seblat National Park, Sumatra, among snared ungulates was greatest for muntjacs and lowest for chevrotains, as assessed by diameter of the cable (Linkie et al. 2003). Chevrotains were more than nine times as abundant in areas of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, with low than with high human population density within 10 km of the park boundary, suggesting low resilience to human presence, presumably the effects of hunting (O'Brien et al. 2003); note that it is not confirmed that this information refers to T. kanchil. Bennett et al. (2000) profiled the effects of hunting in both Bornean states of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah), each with eight study areas, upon chevrotains (not distinguished to species) through a lengthy hunting study in February 1993 to June 1995. They constituted 8\u20139% of animals killed. No direct or index measure of chevrotain densities was possible at these sites to determine what effects, if any, such heavy hunting was having on chevrotains. Chevrotains are among the most favoured wild meat by inhabitants of the Sarawak Planted Forests area, Bintulu, Sarawak, after Sambar Rusa unicolor and wild pigs Sus (Belden Giman pers. comm. 2008). Logging can apparently drive substantial reductions in density, at least locally, although other studies have found it allows an increase in numbers (see Habitat and ecology). No information on the use of plantation landscapes has been traced. In the Greater Sundas, lowland forest is being converted at unprecedented high rates. At least in Borneo, where this species is concentrated in areas below 100 m asl, most of its habitat either has been substantially modified during the last two decades or will be in the next two (e.g. Holmes 2000, BirdLife International 2001, Jepson et al. 2001, McMorrow and Talip 2001, Lambert and Collar 2002, Fuller et al. 2003, Kinnaird et al. 2003, Curran et al. 2004, Fuller 2004, Eames et al. 2005, Aratrakorn et al. 2006). However, inferring proportionately large population losses in Lesser Chevrotain populations is not possible: depending on how serious hunting is and what exactly is being done to the habitat post-logging (forest regeneration, tree plantation or non-woody habitat) in any given area, chevrotain numbers might remain broadly unaffected, decrease or increase in logged-over areas."

    "threats_description": "The species is threatened by several processes. Habitat loss and degradation are thought to be the key threats. Among these, fire suppression is probably the most serious threat, but also urban development, intensive grazing and browsing by livestock and native and introduced ungulates, and agricultural conversion have caused significant habitat loss in North America (Grzybowski 1995, J. Lyons in litt. 1999, USFWS 2018a). In the wintering range, habitat has been cleared for agriculture and grazing, reducing the potential suitable area or causing habitat fragmentation and declines in habitat quality (Miles et al. 2006, Gonz\u00e1lez-Medina et al. 2009). Further threats include brood parasitism. Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) inflict rates of parasitism of up to 100% at some sites (Grzybowski 1995, Farrell et al. 2011). Rates of nest predation as high as 50% in some locations have been reported. Snakes and birds are the primary predators of this species, with mammals, ants (e.g. fire ants Solenopsis spp.) and katydids also found to predate the species (Stake and Cimprich 2003, Campomizzi et al. 2009, Conkling et al. 2012, Smith et al. 2012b). Furthermore, habitat may be fragmented by the development of oil and gas pipelines as well as access corridors for windfarms (L. O'Donnell in litt. 2019). The high return rates of birds to breeding territories suggests few threats on the wintering grounds, even though less than 10% of the wintering area is protected (Grzybowski 1995, Vega Rivera et al. 2011, USFWS 2018a). Deforestation along the presumed migratory routes may potentially have a negative impact on the species (I. MacGregor-Fors in litt. 2016)."

    "threats_description": "Much historically occupied habitat was lost with the clearing of swampland forests. Present threats include: forest destruction (significant in parts of coastal plain); hollow tree removal during certain forest management practices (widespread; noted in Mississippi as important); decreasing availability of abandoned buildings through razing and vandalism (serious threat in coastal plain); insecticide applications, at least in past; vandalism of caves and mines, and closing or blasting mines shut (England et al. 1992). There is considerable potential for loss and degradation of roosting and foraging habitats by commercial logging practices in preferred habitat (Schmidly 2004).This species is very intolerant of disturbance (natural or human) and may abandon roost sites or hibernation sites if subjected to disturbance. Disturbance in winter may arouse bats and cause them to use up fat needed to survive the winter (Harvey 1992). Tendency to roost in cave entrances makes this bat especially vulnerable to disturbance. One roost site was abandoned after the surrounding area was logged."

    "threats_description": "Northern Red Muntjac are hunted widely, both legally and illegally, over most of its range (Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993, Madhusudan and Karanth 2002, Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002, Jathanna et al. 2003, Johnson et al. 2003, Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003, Hansel 2004, Kaul et al. 2004, Kumara and Singh 2004, Rao et al. 2005, Steinmetz et al. 2008), and it is probably among the most used and most desired wild meats in South and South-east Asia (e.g. Srikosamatara et al. 1992, Duckworth et al. 1999). Patterns of threat vary across the species' range. Viet Nam, Lao PDR and to a lesser extent Cambodia and northern Thailand are apparently the areas where mammal hunting has been heaviest. In its mainland China range, rates may be even higher, because a recent fire-arm ban is said to have pushed up levels of gin-trapping (B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2008). Muntjacs are hunted within a thriving hunting and wildlife trading culture in this area and in adjacent countries such as China and Thailand, involving many land vertebrate species, along with other forest products such as orchids and Aquilaria resin (e.g. Compton and Le Hai Quang 1998, Compton et al. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001). Such hunting reaches all areas, although in large rugged mountain forest blocks trade-driven hunting of species valued only for their meat (rather than high-value, low-weight, generally medicinal products that can be carried out efficiently from even the remotest areas) is still limited by economics of accessibility. The regional wild meat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are any pigs, muntjacs, and civets to be hunted. The human population of Viet Nam is more than 90 million, that of China more than 1,000 million. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk et al. 2000). There has been no comparable study of ungulate trade levels. Within the Northern and Central Annamites, every square kilometre of Viet Namese forest and of Lao forest that is within 5 km of the Viet Namese border probably has snares capable of capturing muntjacs set in it every year (Timmins et al. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Intensity in some areas probably reaches many thousands of snare-nights per square kilometre per year (Timmins et al. 2007). Snaring is less intensive in Lao PDR at least away from the Viet Namese border, but is increasing dramatically (Timmins and Robichaud 2005, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. to R.J. Timmins 2007, Coudrat et al. 2014, Timmins and Duckworth 2012, R.J. Timmins in press b, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Hunting intensity had in recent decades been generally lower in southern Viet Nam than in Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, leaving many wildlife populations less depleted (e.g. Le Xuan Canh et al. 1997, Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Polet and Ling 2004), but the general increase in regional hunting intensity and economic wealth indicate that hunting intensity in this region must also be increasing (Timmins et al. 2008), as of 2014 there are indications that hunting intensity has reached equivalent levels to the north, at least in some areas (Timmins in press a). In northern Thailand when muntjacs become rare, the animals are hunted in group drives, the meat is often sold (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002).Closed tropical evergreen forests have inherently low ungulate biomass (Robinson and Bennett 2000), and beyond this populations of all wild animals larger than 20 kg in Indochina have been significantly reduced by human exploitation (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins et al. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Field survey encounter rates with Northern Red Muntjacs in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and Cambodia are remarkably low compared with other areas in its range (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins et al. 2007, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). In a recent reconnaissance survey of highly fragmented habitat in southern Lao PDR (Pathoumphon district, Champasak province), outside the protected area system, muntjac were the only ungulates (assumed to relate to this species on habitat and distribution) for which signs were commonly found, even wild pigs Sus sp(p). being noticeably more scarce (K. Khounboline and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). This pattern is general throughout Lao PDR (K. Khounboline pers. comm. 2008). However, areas of heavy hunting have lost muntjacs or had them reduced to extreme rarity, not only forest isolates such as Houay Nhang (a few square kilometres,, just outside Vientiane, Duckworth et al. 1994) but also, where hunting has been extremely heavy, less fragmented landscapes (such as the western lowlands of Xe Bang-Nouan National Protected Area in south Lao PDR, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In such areas, even though forest within them is in general heavily degraded, habitat is unlikely to be the prime cause of decline, because in some other areas of long-standing forest devastation now dominated by a mix of secondary ruderals, shrubs and grasses, muntjacs are still relatively common, e.g. Phongsali (far northern Lao PDR), where they can even still be heard from the provincial capital town (Duckworth and Robichaud 2005). Similarly, Red Muntjac is common and widespread in Hong Kong, an almost deforested landscape (Chek 2006, R. Corlett pers. comm. 2008), and studies in Hainan indicated selection of openings and other edge habitats rather than forest interiors (Teng et al. 2004), this seems generally true throughout South-east Asia (R.J. Timmins and J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). There is also evidence from elsewhere in its range that this species is better able than most ungulates to withstand a certain degree of continuous harvesting as well as habitat disturbance (Jathanna et al 2003), although this has rarely been based on quantified status assessment. In Nagarahole National Park, India, Madhusudan and Karanth (2002) found no difference in muntjac abundance between a heavily hunted and a lightly hunted site, compared with enormous differences for most other ungulates. In the context of Indochina, even their heavily-hunted site would, however, rank as lightly hunted (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, from based on visit and discussion). Madhusudan and Karanth (2002) cautioned against assuming that these results indicated an intrinsic resilience to hunting by this muntjac: it is not so readily hunted as, for example, Chital Axis axis, because of its solitary nature, affinity for dense cover and therefore risks of getting caught are higher when using appropriate techniques to kill or capture it. However, the ubiquitous disparity in status between M. vaginalis and other ungulates (and indeed almost all other mammals of similar or larger body weight) in Indochina indicates that it is truly much more resilient to hunting. Muntjac populations are capable of recovering quickly from overexploitation if hunting is controlled: an overhunted, low density population freed from hunting pressure in Thailand increased 10-fold in 6 years, a rate of increase that is likely near the biological maximum attainable by the species (Steinmetz et al. 2010). An intensive study of hunting on mammals in two Hmong villages of northern Thailand classified quarry species into tiers representing the sequence of loss through overhunting, muntjacs (most or all were presumably M. vaginalis) fell in the fifth tier, persisting much longer than all other ruminants and with only species like squirrels, civets, and linsangs being placed later in the extinction sequence (Tungittiplakorn and Dearden 2002). Even so, villagers reported that muntjacs were greatly reduced in numbers in the area. The strongest demonstration of its remarkable resilience is that it is now common and widespread in Hong Kong, an almost deforested landscape which has in the past sustained hunting and habitat disruption heavy enough to force extinction even of squirrels. Red Muntjac were reduced to very low populations a few decades ago, but did not become extinct, and has increased rapidly in recent years (Shek 2006, R. Corlett pers. comm. 2008).While wild meat is the major driver of South-east Asian muntjac trade, parts such as antlers are also heavily traded (e.g. Duckworth et al. 1999, Noreen and Claridge 2001).Rapid economic development and expanding wealth in the species' range, particularly South-east Asia and China, are increasing the demand for wildlife meat and \u2018medicines\u2019 (Timmins et al. 2007). Timmins et al. (2007) highlighted a common misconception, especially in documentation of development projects in the region, that poverty is a principal cause of biodiversity loss, but as they pointed out for Saola Pseudoryx nghetinhensis, the main driver of threats to wild ungulates, at least for the mid-term, is not rural poverty but increasing urban wealth in Indochina and China. Similarly, in Thailand, trade-driven hunting has been the main cause of muntjac and other wildlife population declines, regardless of protected area status (Steinmetz et al. 2006). In Viet Nam \u201cthe free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity\u201d (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving bushmeat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Maxwell et al. 2006, Timmins 2006). There is a rapid, ongoing, expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, directly accelerated by illegal trade in rosewood, wild meat, and other forest resources, and by the economics of large infrastructure projects (e.g. Nan Theun 2 hydro-electric power project), creating a significantly greater in-country demand for luxury meats such as venison (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2007). Wild meat is chosen in preference to farmed meat despite a greater price per unit weight (e.g. Hansel 2004). Markets along major roads such as route 13 (e.g. at Ban Namthon) have expanded, not contracted, in the last 15 years and have a huge (albeit unquantified) turnover of wild meat, at this specific market, multiple stalls are selling dried muntjac meat daily (balance of muntjac species unknown). The effects of hunting in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand have been exacerbated during the last two decades by habitat loss and various socio-economic factors, of which the most biologically significant are discussed in the Red List account for Large-antlered Muntjac M. vuquangensis.Thus, even though this is one of the most resilient of large mammals in Indochina persisting in fragmented landscapes and often in peripheral forest areas, populations in Indochina (Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia) are likely to be declining significantly (perhaps at a level to trigger VU i.e. 30% in 10\u201315 years, for the regional population) (Timmins et al. 2008). Densities especially in Lao PDR and Viet Nam are generally well below carrying capacity, although in extensive areas of Cambodia are likely to be more natural, as they are across the range west of the Mekong (Timmins et al. 2008). Since 2008 rates of decline in Indochina have almost certainly increased and are now quite likely to be in the region of \u201830% in 10\u201315 years\u2019, especially in Lao and Cambodia where economic growth has seen widespread landscape level changes in infrastructure and land use and concomitant rise in the value of bushmeat and in hunting pressure, although most areas in Vietnam may have already been so depleted prior to 2008 that hunting of residual animals has been relatively difficult since then, thus tempering decline rates, even though hunting intensity has probably increased (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014)."

    "threats_description": "Habitat destruction is certainly the main type of threat to this species, at least in Brazil where the deforestation in Amazonia started by the early decade of 1970 and reached 16.2% (forest loss) of the original forest in 2003 (Fearnside 2005). This threat is particularly strong across the \u201cdeforestation arch\u201d in the southern Brazilian Amazon, a region that extends from the state of Acre eastward to the southern states of Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o.Although the Amazon forest has been destroyed for many reasons, the main cause of deforestation is cattle raising, responsible for 70% of forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon (Fearnside 2005). Besides the destruction of forest, the cattle itself may negatively affect deer populations through a variety of parasitic, bacterial or viral diseases that can contaminate them. Indeed, Pinder and Leeuwenberg (1997) mentioned that there are reports of high mortality rates of deer previously in contact with ill cattle in the Brazilian Pantanal region and the states of Maranh\u00e3o and Minas Gerais. The extent to which the cattle affect populations of M. nemorivaga is unknown.Fortunately, overhunting appears not to be a threat to Mazama nemorivaga. This species is usually less abundant than the sympatric red brocket deer (M. americana), but also has lower hunting pressure. Branan et al. (1985) reported the harvest of 5 individuals of the former species against 57 individuals of the latter by Surinamese hunters in 1980 and 1981. Similarly, Hurtado-Gonzales and Bodmer (2004) found a rate of 0.06 individuals hunted/km\u00b2 for M. nemorivaga in contrast to 0.17 individuals hunted/km\u00b2 for M. americana in a heavy hunted site in northeastern Peru. In addition to the low hunting pressure, most studies on the sustainability of hunting by Peruvian rural and indigenous people reported that the harvest of Mazama nemorivaga is within sustainable limits (Ascorra 1997, Bodmer 1995, Bodmer et al. 1997, Hurtado-Gonzales and Bodmer 2004, Mena et al. 2000). There are two likely reasons for that. First, brockets (including M. americana and M. nemorivaga) can be categorized as less vulnerable to overhunting because of their fast rates of reproduction and intrinsic rates of population increase, allied to the ability of dispersal and difficulty of capture (see Bodmer et al. 1997, and Hurtado-Gonzales and Bodmer 2004). Second, slightly or unhunted areas adjacent to persistently hunted ones may have been acting as sources of game, as claimed by Novaro et al. (2000). According to them, 47 to 87% of unhunted area close to the catchment site is required to prevent a population decline of Amazonian Brown Brocket in the Peruvian Amazon."

Urban development in certain areas may also have an effect, as this will only exacerbate the problem of restoring and implementing fire regimes that are beneficial for this species (P.

    "threats_description": "Within the US, declines may be related to the spread of fire ants, use of insecticides to control fire ants, heavy agricultural use of land and/or other habitat alterations, and overcollecting for the pet and curio trade (Price 1990, Carpenter et al. 1993, Donaldson et al. 1994). This species is extremely vulnerable to changes in habitat, especially the loss of harvester ants (Carpenter et al. 1993). Harvester ants comprise up to 69% of the diet (Pianka and Parker 1975), and fire ants are thought to out-compete native harvester ants for food and space (Henke and Fair 1998). This threat may be significant in parts of Texas but probably not elsewhere. Intensive agriculture (plowing) could destroy adults and their eggs (Carpenter et al. 1993, Donaldson et al. 1994) but, according to Henke and Fair (1998), reports of declines due to loss of habitat caused by urbanization, suburban sprawl, and conversion of native rangeland to agricultural crops are mostly unsubstantiated (Henke and Fair 1998). The widespread use of broadcast insecticides is also thought to contribute to declines. Insecticides can be detrimental by directly causing illness or death or indirectly by severely reducing or eliminating harvester ants (Henke and Fair 1998). In the past, this lizard was collected for the pet trade, by boy scout troops for trading at jamborees, for the curio trade, and by tourists (Donaldson et al. 1994, Henke and Fair 1998). Mortality from road traffic is an important local threat in some areas. Males are particularly vulnerable during May-June in Arizona-New Mexico (Sherbrooke 2002). A high level of road mortality may lead to significant local declines. There appear to be no threats to this species in Mexico."

In Bolivia the populations seem to be staying constant in spite of great hunting pressure. In Brazil this is the most abundant deer species in the country, but populations are declining in certain areas (Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro). In Paraguay, the populations in general are remaining constant, but the species has disappeared from recently urbanized areas and areas of high human density. In general there is heaving hunting pressure and loss of animals due to kills by dogs as well as habitat loss."

    "threats_description": "Large numbers of pelts were exported from South America for the international fur trade from the 1960s to 1980s, but little trade took place after 1988 and the species was upgraded to CITES Appendix I in 1992 (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Cats are still killed as pests or poultry predators, and these pelts may be seen in local illegal trade. Currently, habitat loss and fragmentation, and retaliatory killing remains as the main threats. Potential negative impacts from current trends in climate change have been proposed (Canepuccia et al. 2008, Pereira et al. 2014)During a health evaluation of Geoffroy\u00b4s Cats (Uhart et al. 2012) at two different protected areas in Argentina (Campos del Tuyu Wildlife Reserve and Lihu\u00e9 Calel National Park), antibodies to infectious peritonitis, feline panleukopenia, canine distemper virus, feline callicivirus, toxoplasmosis and dirofilariasis were found in tested animals. Adult parasites recovered from necropsied animals and eggs in fresh faeces revealed the presence of various nematode families, including Ascarididae, Trichuridae, Capillariideae, Rictulariidae, Spiruridae and Ancylostomatidae; cestodes from families Taenidae and Anaplocephaliidae and oocists of Eimeriidae (Beldomenico et al. 2005). These results suggest exposure (recent or past) to common domestic carnivore diseases, and indicate a potential risk to these Geoffroy\u00b4s Cats.Human-related mortality accounted for most of Geoffroy\u2019s Cat deaths recorded on cattle ranches near Lihu\u00e9 Calel National Park, with poaching, predation by dogs, and vehicle collision being the main causes of mortality (Pereira et al. 2010)."

    "threats_description": "The species is quite sensitive to changes in habitat, including loss and fragmentation of forests, bush groves and meadows (with the isolation of subpopulations), and the drainage and pollution of wetlands (industrial and agricultural) and predatory fish species (e.g. Procambarus clarkii American Crayfish). These impacts on metapopulations, particularly the latter, have led to local subpopulation declines. Road mortalities are also considered to be a threat (Ortiz-Santaliestra 2015). Climatic changes are likely to have negative effects on subpopulations, in particular on places where this species occurs in sympatry with Hyla meridionalis which would be more adaptable to warmer temperatures (Mallard 2018). Species distribution modelling projects contractions of the species' potential range of 75\u201380% in the period 2041\u20132070 (Ara\u00fajo et al. 2011).Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a possible threat to this species, and has been detected in its congener Hyla arborea (Europe Red List Assessment Workshop September 2019)."

    "threats_description": "Chlorocebus tantalus is common and highly adaptable over its range. There are presumed to be no major predatory threats. As with others in their genus, the Tantalus Monkey\u2019s affinity for crop-raiding can result in frequent human-wildlife conflict, which impacts their numbers in some locations. However, because they often live near Patas Monkeys or Olive Baboons (Papio anubis), both of which are larger and bolder in their crop-raiding efforts, the Tantalus Monkey may often escape blame (and persecution). As mentioned, hunting Tantalus Monkeys for their meat by humans is not widely reported, perhaps due to their relatively small size, although Hema et al. (2019) found the species for sale as part of their bushmeat survey in Burkina Faso. Occasionally, these monkeys become ensnared by traps set for other wildlife in their habitat or struck by vehicles on roads (Wallis pers. obs. 2009 in Uganda). With widespread habitat depletion and forecasts for dramatic ecosystem responses to climate conditions reported for parts of Africa (e.g., Ponce-Reyes et al. 2017), the Tantalus Monkey may eventually face increasing challenges due to climate change. Thus, their numbers should be monitored, and further study of their distribution is recommended."

Damage to habitat includes drainage of marshes and the dredging of drainage canals that are used by the frogs as breeding sites. These frogs are intolerant of pollution, and the run-off of pesticides and fertilizers is believed to be a major contributor to localized population declines (COSEWIC 2011). Introduced American Bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) have also been implicated as possible determinants of cricket frog range contractions although this is yet to be substantiated (Burdick and Swanson 2010)."

    "threats_description": "There are currently no major threats to this species that reduce population numbers across its range. However, some populations are under local pressure from agriculture and development projects. Although not well documented, they are hunted for bushmeat in some areas (Wallis pers. obs. Tanzania 1991, Wallis pers. obs. in Nigeria 2006\u20132008, van Vliet et al. 2012). The potential for increased hunting pressure should be monitored. With rising numbers in the human population and declining numbers of other wildlife species, Olive Baboons may eventually become a more sought-after target; at 30 kg, an adult male provides a substantial source of protein. It should be noted that Olive Baboons have been found to harbour Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses (SIV) (Peeters et al. 2002) and Ebola virus (Leroy et al. 2004), thus highlighting the health risks of baboon meat consumption to humans. Both Papio anubis and P. cynocephalus are naturally infected with Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue, the bacterium that causes human yaws and closely related to the bacterium that causes syphilis (T. p. pallidum) (see Harper et al. 2012, Chuma et al. 2019). In Papio sp., the infection appears to spread through sexual contact and is associated with open lesions in and around the genitalia of both sexes. The degree of morbidity varies, including some cases of deaths occurring in the Tanzania\u2019s Gombe National Park\u2019s Olive Baboons, when the genitalia are so badly damaged that urinary flow was obstructed (Wallis and Lee 1999). Similar lesions appear in some other Olive Baboon populations throughout their range, most notably in Lake Manyara National Park in Tanzania (Chuma et al. 2019) and Yankari Game Reserve in Nigeria (Wallis pers. obs. 2007). Thus, although hunting pressure, persecution for crop-raiding and incidence of disease transmission do not currently constitute \u201cmajor threats\u201d, both phenomena merit attention and monitoring."

    "threats_description": "Widespread forest loss and fragmentation throughout its range are the main threats to Alouatta guariba. Its distributional range largely correlates with the most densely populated regions of Brazil. Only 12% of the original forest coverage is remaining in these areas, fragmented into almost 250 forest fragments, 83.4% of which are smaller than 50 ha (Ribeiro et al. 2009). It is suspected that the current scenario of small isolated subpopulations, may progressively aggravate the synergistic, demographic and genetic effects of the severely fragmented habitat, including the increase of inbreeding. However, the species is able to survive in quite small forest fragments if there is no hunting. Especially in the northern part of its range it suffers from hunting pressure at different levels (Canale et al. 2012). Furthermore, the species is highly susceptible to yellow fever, and an outbreak in 2008-2009 killed a large number of individuals, with local extinctions recorded in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Almeida et al. 2012, Fialho et al. 2012), and Misiones, Argentina (Holzmann et al. 2010). This epidemic resulted in lethal aggression from local communities due to a fear of direct transmission from howler monkeys (Bicca-Marques and Freitas 2010). In addition, many subpopulations are affected by urban expansion and infrastructure developments. This includes accidents with vehicles and power lines and predation by dogs (Printes 1999, Pasquotto et al. 2002, Galetti and Sazima 2006, Fries et al. 2007, Lokschin et al. 2007, S\u00e3o Paulo (Cidade) 2011, Buss 2012)."

    "threats_description": "Blue Duck are affected by a wide range of threats. These include natural and introduced predators, human-induced threats and stochastic environmental and weather events (Riddler 2009).The species is susceptible to a variety of introduced predators such as feral cats Felis catus, rats Rattus spp, stoats Mustela erminea, ferrets Mustela furo, weasel Mustela nivalis vulgasis, dogs Canis familiaris and Brush-tailed Possum Trichosurus vulpecula. They are also vulnerable to natural predators such as weka Gallirallus australis, Swamp Harrier Circus approximans, New Zealand Falcon Falco novaeseelandiae and eels Anguilla dieffenbachia (Adams et al. 1997, Glaser et al. 2010). Predation of eggs, young and incubating females by stoats was found to be the most significant threat to the species in Fiordland (Whitehead et al. 2008), and across the rest of the species' range (Glaser et al. 2010). Nesting failure in untreated environments has been recorded to be as high as 91% which has largely been attributed to stoat predation (Glaser and Allerby 2010). The greatest predation pressure occurs in cycle with beech mast years, as rodent populations explode, causing a lagged increase in stoat populations which seek alternative prey when rodent numbers crash (Whitehead et al. 2008). A male-biased sex-ratio has been observed throughout the range, indicating that predation during incubation (which is almost exclusively carried out by the female) is significant (Glaser et al. 2010). Stoat predation has also been attributed to 46% female mortality during moult when birds retreat to small tributaries during this flightless period (Glaser and Allerby 2010). Nesting success has been shown to be very high following predator control before dropping in subsequent years, and is higher with increasing distance to the interior of treatment blocks (Steffens et al. 2022).Human-induced impacts such as road fatalities, shooting, wire-strikes and management manipulations during catching and handling also directly impact the species (Riddler 2009). Previously, grazing and clearance of waterside vegetation decreased water quality and led to the species disappearing from lowland rivers. Hydroelectric dams have altered the flow of some rivers, reducing available habitat (Heather and Robertson 2015), but increases in flow rates implemented from 2004 have mediated some of the impacts (Stier 2008). The Tongariro Power Scheme\u2019s Western Diversion Rivers has completed surveys since 1998 to assess the effectiveness of minimum flows established in 2004. The total number of pairs has almost quadrupled since 1998 (to 30 pairs in this reach). Pair densities are now very high in some reaches, with the average territory length on one of the Whanganui Reaches being just 170 m per pair. Stability through both the winter and breeding season results in high invertebrate abundance which assists with body conditioning and rearing. This in combination with predator control through aerial 1080 operations (by TB Free New Zealand bovine TB control programme and Department of Conservation) as well as predator trapping has reduced the threats (Swanney 2014).Poor dispersal in some catchments reduces recolonisation and prevents mixing of nearby populations (Williams 1988). A high percentage of mortality (66%) in juvenile fledglings during the transient period of establishing new territories has been documented in the Ruahine Forest Park in the absence of predator control (Glaser in litt. 2016). Fledglings can travel up to 20.5 km from their point of natal origin, across catchments to the extent of suitable forested habitat into unprotected environments (Glaser 2003). Difficulty in linking catchments due to the high level of conservation management required by the species means many populations are vulnerable to isolation and genetic bottlenecks over time (A. Glaser in litt. 2022). Introduced trout Salmo trutta may compete for food (Heather and Robertson 2015), and birds caught in discarded fishing line have been reported (Young 2009). Human activities on the rivers often cause significant disturbance (Adams et al. 1997), and sub-division of land for development has recently occurred adjacent to rivers occupied by the species (Young 2009). The introduced alga Didymo may reduce habitat quality, and avian diseases have the potential to significantly impact populations if introduced (Glaser et al. 2010). The species' vulnerability to catastrophic events has also been documented over the years. Avalanches, slips, lahars and flood events can fragment broods, reduce food availability and cause individuals to move into small side streams where they lose their natural defence of escape through the water (Glaser and Allerby 2010). The combination of predation by introduced species and anthropogenic climate change causing severe flood events indicated that the species has only a limited probability of persistence during the next 100 years. Importantly, the additive effects of population losses due to predation and a rising frequency of floods (as predicted by general circulation models) increases extinction risk by 69% (Simpkins et al. 2015)."

    "threats_description": "Deforestation and conversion of habitat are the major threats to the species as a whole, as oil palm plantations are expanding greatly within its range at the expense of lowland forest habitat. Specifically for P. s. cana in the eastern forests of Central Sumatra, severe habitat degradation is underway in Tesso Nilo National Park, Kampar forest, and Kerumutan protected area due to frequent burning, logging, and road construction. This has resulted in habitat decline of up to almost 60% in the last decade (Supriatna and Mariati 2014). For P. s. rhionis in Bintan Island, approximately 70% of the land area had already been converted from forest to rubber gardens, industrial areas, tourist resorts and roads by the 1990s (Yanuar 1993/1994). Currently, land area on Bintan is still being converted to resorts and other tourist facilities. In 2011, it was announced that a new airport scheduled for completion in 2017 and more tourist facilities including resorts would be built in Bintan to enhance infrastructure so as to attract more tourists (The Straits Times Indonesia and Jakarta Globe 2011)."

    "threats_description": "Appendix 2 of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) provides a global and country-by-country threat assessment based on the GSLEP-supported exercise drawing loosely on the Threats Reduction Assessment (TRA) protocol of Salafsky and Margoluis (1999) and involving select experts from each range country. McCarthy and Mallon (2016) include several chapters exploring well-known and emerging threats including livestock depredation, prey declines, disease, illegal trade, climate change, and resource extraction. There is considerable variation in the type and extent of threat among countries, especially with respect to large countries such as China or Mongolia where suitable habitat is extensive and split across different administrative regions. The main ongoing threats fall into three broad areas: 1) competition with livestock, habitat degradation and declines in prey; 2) depredation by Snow Leopards on livestock and retaliatory killing; 3) illegal trade in furs, bones and other body parts. New threats have been identified since 2003, including climate change, mining, large scale infrastructure and barriers such as roads or fenced railway lines (Wingard et al. 2014, Zahler 2016); however, the potential impact of these emerging threats on Snow Leopards or their habitat is as yet difficult to quantify. A further set of threats regarded as less severe at the range-wide level, or at least more localized, include the lack of awareness among local people and policymakers, insufficient institutional capacity and law enforcement, and limited transboundary collaboration.Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below: Recently Nowell et al. (2016) found that over 90% of annual Snow Leopard poaching is estimated to occur in five range countries: China (103-236 animals poached per year), Mongolia (34-53), Pakistan (23-53), India (21-45) and Tajikistan (20-25). While the highest levels of poaching and illegal trade are in China, which has the largest share of Snow Leopard range, countries with smaller shares of global range were flagged for having disproportionately high levels of estimated poaching (Nepal and Pakistan) and illegal Snow Leopard trade (Afghanistan and Russia). Afghanistan, Bhutan and Kazakhstan had markedly low levels of seizures compared to observations of poaching and illegal trade, suggesting the need for strengthened law enforcement in these countries (Nowell et al. 2016)."

    "threats_description": "It is locally impacted by high accidental mortality on roads, especially close to urban or tourist areas, but this is not considered to be a major threat to the species overall. It is also persecuted throughout its range because people mistakenly believe it to be venomous. Analysis of seven years of data from a site in western France suggested that mortality from persecution is predominantly at the peak of the reproductive season in adults, and during dispersal from nests in subadults and juveniles (Meek 2012). Predation from cats and dogs, mainly of younger age classes, was also documented during this work (Meek 2012). It is not known to be collected in significant numbers. It is threatened by habitat loss through conversion of land to intensive agricultural use in Switzerland (Monney &amp; Meyer, 2005)."

    "threats_description": "Although there do not appear to be any current major threats to Thomson's Gazelle, there is evidence that several subpopulations have undergone declines (FitzGibbon and Wilmshurst 2013). In Ngorongoro Crater, these declines have been attributed to many complex reasons including: availability of water, tourist impacts, habitat modification due to exotic plant invasion, fire management, and road development (Estes et al. 2006). Illegal hunting is a major concern in the west and north of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem (Arcese et al. 1995). The decline in the Serengeti has been suggested to be linked to the increase in the number of Wildebeest, which are competitors for food (Foley et al. 2014)."

    "threats_description": "This species is threatened by forest conversion, mining, road construction, human encroachment and opportunistic poaching for pet trade and human consumption on Sumatra, with these threats often extending to populations in national parks and protected forests. Between 1985 and 2007 on Sumatra, over 40% of the conceivable habitat for this species was lost to fires, logging, road development and conversion to agriculture or plantations (Laumonier et al. 2010). The forests, where they remain, are extremely fragmented (Margono et al. 2012). Agricultural expansion (e.g., coffee, oil palm, and rubber), in addition to the expansion of pulp-paper and sawn-timber plantations are currently the main drivers of forest loss on Sumatra (O'Brien and Kinnaird 2003; Margono et al. 2012). A recent report indicates that siamang are often encountered in Indonesian wildlife markets and are a common species entering the Kalaweit rehabilitation center in Padang, Sumatra, Indonesia (Estrada et al. 2018; Nijman 2005; Nijman et al. 2009). Furthermore, Lappan et al. (2017) have highlighted that between 2011 and 2016 that roughly 50% of their Way Canguk study population disappeared, possibly related to an epizootic disease outbreak. A similar case was described for a study group of wild siamangs at Ketambe (Palombit 1992). Based on the recent data provided by Global Forest Watch, the rate of forest loss on Sumatra has accelerated over the last five years and, if that pace continues, it is possible to project a loss of nearly 60% of suitable forest habitat by mid-century.The species' status in Malaysia is more uncertain, however, as with Sumatra, oil palm expansion has been identified as one of the main causes of deforestation in Peninsular Malaysia (Miyamoto et al. 2014). Also, as in Sumatra, rates of forest loss have accelerated over the last several years and are likely to range between 70-100% within the range of Symphalangus syndactylus.In Thailand, there is extensive conversion of forests to rubber plantations and other crops (even inside protected areas), as well as hunting for the pet trade. Global Forest Watch data indicate that forest loss within the restricted range of siamangs in southern Thailand could be as much as 50% by the year 2050."

    "threats_description": "Climate change is potentially the greatest threat to this species at present and in the future. It is thought to impact reproductive success through incurring changes in abundance and distribution of krill (Trivelpiece et al. 2011, Clucas et al. 2014), though these effects have been noted only in parts of the range (Lynch et al. 2016). Changes in krill biomass and availability resulting from habitat shifts are thought to be driving rapid declines at a number of colonies (Barbosa et al. 2012, Lynch et al. 2012, Naveen et al. 2012, Dunn et al. 2016). In addition, there is considerable overlap between the expanding krill fishery and the species\u2019s foraging distribution, hence there is potential for resource competition, potentially aggravating the climatic effects on krill availability (Hinke 2017, Warwick-Evans et al. 2018; Trathan et al. 2018).Volcanic activity during the 2016 moulting season at Zavodovski and Bristol in the South Sandwich Islands could have had severe impacts on the large colonies residing there, and surveys of the breeding colonies at the South Sandwich Islands should be repeated. If large numbers are found to have been killed by the volcanic event, and if declines elsewhere on the Antarctic Peninsula continue, the species may warrant uplisting.Human impacts potentially include disturbance from tourists, scientists, construction of new science facilities and fisheries. However, only a very small percentage of the global population is exposed to human intrusion and there is currently no documented evidence of population-level impacts (J. Croxall in litt. 2017)."

    "threats_description": "There are several potential threats identified for this species. The Mountain Hare has successfully hybridized with L. europaeus in areas where the latter has been introduced (Thulin 2003). The pathogens, European Brown Hare Syndrome (EHBS) and Tularemia, are considered problematic, but require research to determine how great an impact they inflict (Thulin 2003). Competitive exclusion occurring between the Mountain Hare and the European Hare could be restricting the distribution of the former (Thulin 2003). The discovery of an introduced population of L. europaeus to Ireland could pose a threat to L. t. hibernicus (Reid 2011). More recently abundance has been reduced by a lack of duration of snow cover caused by global warming (Pedersen et al. 2017)."

Current estimates are that the population has declined by less than 20% since the 1980's. This figure is derived from another estimate that the available habitat has declined by approximately 20% since the 1950's. Predictions are that available habitat will continue to decline until the year 2024 (Robinson et al. 2016).In Africa, loss of habitat and fragmentation due to agricultural practices, urban sprawl, commercial plantations, and tourism development pose a threat to the Cape Hare, as well as hunting (sport and subsistence) (Kryger et al. 2004, Robinson et al. 2016)."

Large areas of the southwestern and southern range of the species has been transformed, with little remaining natural habitat (Driver et al. 2012). A future threat is climate change, which will have a large impact on the Fynbos Biome of the southern Cape (Driver et al. 2012, Schoeman et al. 2013). The small size of individuals makes them particularly vulnerable to predation by Pied Crows (Fincham and Lambrechts 2014) and small mammals. Furthermore, an increase in fire frequency decimates populations. Homopus areolatus is sympatric with Psammobates geometricus and Chersina angulata at some sites (M.D. Hofmeyr and B.T. Henen pers. obs.), indicating that many of the same threats impact, and conservation actions would benefit, all the sympatric species."

    "threats_description": "During the early 1990s, populations of Caiman yacare were considered to be somewhat depleted in all four range states, principally due to widespread illegal hunting during the 1970s and 1980s. Illegal hunting is no longer a problem although continued small scale local exploitation for meat still occurs. Habitat destruction, construction of hydroelectric dams, and siltation of rivers continue to affect caiman populations, particularly in Brazil. However, the very large area of distribution and currently small proportion of habitat affected minimizes these impacts. Due to its small size at maturity, ability to adapt to a wide variety of habitat types, and learned wariness, C. yacare is particularly resilient to hunting pressure. Studies in Brazil suggest that illegal hunting did not seriously impact populations (Mour\u00e3o et al. 1996). Surveys in Paraguay (Scott et al. 1990, King et al. 1994) and Argentina (Siroski 2004, Pi\u00f1a et al. 2009) indicate that extensive populations remain or have recovered from previous exploitation, since the closure of uncontrolled hunting and implementation of export controls."

Logging, human settlement, cattle grazing, mining and coca and palm cultivation pose threats to remaining forests (Dinerstein et al. 1995), though tree cover loss within the range is currently low (Global Forest Watch 2022). Locally, there is low reproductive success owing to competition for nest-sites with, and predation of young by, Plate-billed Mountain-toucan Andigena laminirostris (Restrepo and Mondrag\u00f3n 1987, Renjifo et al. 2014)."

Local threats in Arkansas include draining and alteration of wetlands, but overall this species is not endangered or threatened there (Trauth et al. 2004). This snake often occurs in isolated colonies throughout its range (Werler and Dixon 2000); consequently, extirpated populations may not be readily reestablished through natural dispersal mechanisms. Werler and Dixon (2000) reported that this snake may prosper in the face of expanding human development, and they noted the persistence of this species in urban parklands in Missouri and Texas. Overall, this species does not appear to be very threatened, but better information is needed on current trends and threats."

    "threats_description": "Gang-gang Cockatoos are among the least studied species in the family in Australia, and there is inadequate understanding of the reasons they have been declining (Cameron 2007). Plausible threats include the loss of habitat through land clearing, particularly along the slopes of the Great Dividing Range, and a reduction in nest hollow availability due to forest management practices (NSW OEH 2020). For urban populations, clearing for housing can lead to the destruction of nest sites. Gang-gang Cockatoos breed mainly in mature forest (Loyn 1985) and decline with increasing removal of old trees (Loyn and Kennedy 2009). Fire poses a threat, destroying nest trees and suppressing seed production in key feed species (Koch 2003). Higher temperatures may also be having an effect (Herold et al. 2018), with heat waves implicated in the premature fledging of nestling Gang-gang Cockatoos (Cameron et al. 2021). Extreme fire weather (Di Virgilio et al. 2019, Dowdy et al. 2019) driven by longer and more severe droughts (Evans et al. 2017) and more frequent heat waves (Herold et al. 2018) are likely to increase in frequency and intensity in coming decades. Given the broad-scale reduction in older-aged montane forests (Lindenmayer et al. 2015), and the time required for trees to form large hollows, it is plausible that hollow availability has declined across the range, probably leading to increased competition for hollows from other hollow-dependent birds, mammals and maybe European honey bees Apis melifera (Davey et al. 2019, M. Cameron unpublished, in Cameron et al. 2021). However, most threats are speculative."

    "threats_description": "Although the species may benefit from deforestation, such positive effects may be outweighed by the negative impacts of spreading cultivation and urbanisation (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The excessive burning of grasslands may suppress populations of prey species, whilst the intensive grazing of livestock is also probably degrading otherwise suitable habitat (Baker et al. 2011). The Grassland Biome in South Africa is threatened by the expansion of woody vegetation, which would translate to direct habitat loss and a possible reduction in foraging efficacy (Colyn et al., 2020, in review). In Kenya, suitable habitat is being converted to other land uses, particularly for commercial purposes (B. Amakobe in litt. 2020). Disturbance by humans, probably most often herders, is likely to negatively affect breeding. The species is captured and traded in apparently small numbers; however, it is unknown how many die in captivity and transit. Direct hunting and nest-raiding for other uses and indiscriminate poisoning at waterholes are also potential threats. Exposure to secondary pesticide poisoning is a concern, and birds are also susceptible to negative impacts from collisions with fence lines and electric cables (Whitecross et al. 2019). 94 power-line fatalities have been recorded in 20 years by the Endangered Wildlife Trust (A. Botha in litt. 2020). Large ranging behaviour outside of protected areas increases their risk of injury and fatality (Whitecross et al. 2019). These human-induced threats may compound the effects of severe droughts in some areas (Baker et al. 2011)."

However, future global climatic changes could affect seasonal arid cycles in parts of its range. This species may also be threatened by disease, as the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been found to infect individuals of related species. It is unknown if this species is susceptible to Bd infection. Additionally, ranaviruses have been responsible for die-offs in both captive and wild amphibian populations, and in many ways are well suited to cause mass die-offs and even local extinctions (Lesbarr\u00e8res et al. 2012). While this species is not currently known to be infected, it is important that managers be vigilant."

    "threats_description": "This species is vulnerable to fish introduction and breeding habitat destruction (drainage of wetlands and aquatic pollution) throughout its range. Following fish introductions, most populations rapidly become extinct (particularly alternative paedomorphic populations); some taxa (if taxonomy justified) have disappeared following fish introductions (e.g., Ichthyosaura alpestris lacustris [M. Deno\u00ebl pers. comm.). In some areas it is collected in excess for use in education and science (this has led to the extinction of the species from some Ukrainian localities). It is also collected in small numbers for the commercial pet trade (especially I. a. inexpectatus of Calabria). Subpopulations in the Peloponnese and southeastern continental Greece are facing severe habitat loss.Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to B. dendrobatidis (Bd), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world. Both pathogens cause the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, and both are believed to have originated in Asia (for Bsal: Martel et al. 2014, for Bd: O'Hanlon et al. 2018). While Bd can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, Bsal has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel et al. 2013). Bd has spread globally, but at present Bsal is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel et al. 2014, Nguyen et al. 2017). Currently in Europe, Bsal has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g. Thein et al. 2020) and Spain (Martel et al. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel et al. 2014). Laboratory trials for susceptibility to BSal have demonstrated that this species is moderately susceptible to infection, however, mortality rate varied by dosage with high dosages resulting in high mortality and low dosages with low mortality (Gilbert et al. 2020, F. Pasmans and A. Martel pers. comm. June 2021). Thus, it may be a threat to this species but further research is required to determine the full effects."

Habitat loss is not yet a great problem, but it is believed that in future years it could become so (del Hoyo et al. 2020). It is thought the intensification of agriculture and forestry, as well as the conversion of pasture to arable land can affect populations of this species by reducing the population of ants. The clearing of wooded hedgerows, copses, isolated groves and riverine woodland can limit potential nesting sites. Wildfires may have caused a decrease in the populations in Mediterranean regions. Other threats include localized illegal hunting and very cold winters (Mart\u00ed and del Moral 2004)."

The breeding success of the species was dramatically reduced after the water-level in Lake Sevan (Armenia) was lowered due to extraction for irrigation and hydropower production (Adamian and Klem Jr. 1999). Further threats in Armenia include poaching in the fish-farms of Ararat Plain, where non-breeding individuals concentrate year-round and adult individuals concentrate during wintering; eutrophication of the Lake Sevan due to algal blooms (from sewage and agricultural run off, and declines in macroinvertebrates and macrophytes), affecting food supply; and further decreases of the water level from dam repairs (Aghababyan et al. in prep.). Modernization of sewage and rubbish treatment facilities have likely reduced habitat quality within Israel and birds that used to winter in these areas may have moved elsewhere (A. Ben Dov in litt. 2015). The gulls also feed on garbage dumps in Armenia, with recycling of municipal waste causing declines in food (K. Aghababyan in litt. 2021) The lake where the species has been recorded breeding in Iran, Lake Urumiyeh in Azarbaijan province, has decreased greatly in size (A. Ben Dov in litt. 2015)."

    "threats_description": "The primary threat is loss and degradation of wetlands as a result of upstream river regulation, intensified agriculture, mining, drainage, invasive species such as Mimosa pigra, and rice cultivation (Burke 1996, W. R. J. Dean in litt. 1999, Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002, McCann and Benn 2006, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Uys 2012). Other threats include nest disturbance (P. Leonard in litt. 1999, P. Mundy in litt. 1999, McCann and Benn 2006); grass-burning regimes (M. Herremans &amp; R. E. Simmons in litt. 1999, T. Dodman in litt. 2000, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006), though in the non-breeding season burnt floodplains are used for feeding in some areas (Hancock et al. 2003); poisoning; collision with utility lines (Burke 1996); direct consumption of chicks; persecution, and traditional medicine (A. Shimelis in litt. 1998). Increasing livestock farming, wars, desertification and agrochemicals are additional threats to the species's habitats (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Nest destruction through trampling by livestock is believed to be a problem (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The population is threatened by the illegal removal of eggs and chicks for international trade (Pittman 2007). Adults are also taken for trade and are hunted (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The level of exports from Tanzania is believed to exceed known legal exports (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The destruction of vegetation by fires probably leaves adults more susceptible to predation and hunting, and flood levels in turn influence the extent and intensity of fires (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Recent potential threats that could extensively affect a large portion of the Okavango Delta include the proposed hydroelectric scheme at Popa Falls in Namibia, papyrus cutting, channel modification, and the extensive aerial spraying of pesticide to eradicate the tsetse fly (Hancock et al. 2003). The extent of suitable breeding habitat in the Zambezi Delta (Mozambique) and Kafue Flats (Zambia) and the suitability of remaining habitat for feeding is believed to have declined as a result of the interruption of the natural flooding regime by the Cahora Bassa (Tete province), Kariba (Zambia/Zimbabwe), and Itezhi-tezhi (Zambia) dams upstream, and hunting is also a threat in this country (Parker 2005, Bento et al. 2007). Breeding success appears to be low in the species (Hancock 2003, Mostumi and Hancock 2004b). A pre-fledging chick:adult ratio of 5.8% on the Okavango Delta in January 2003 indicates a low chick survival rate (Hancock 2003). However, each pair of this long-lived species needs to raise only two chicks that survive to adulthood over the course of their lifetimes for the population to remain stable (Hancock et al. 2003). The species is highly sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon home ranges which are impacted by adjacent land-use (Morrison and Bothma 1998)."

    "threats_description": "A major threat to the species is loss of nesting habitat due to clearance for small-scale use, agriculture, and because of fires and violent storms (L. Kemp in litt. 2016). It can become heat stressed and exhibits heat avoidance behaviour in temperatures above 26oC, and increasing temperatures with climate change could pose a threat (L. Kemp in litt. 2016). Widespread livestock grazing has also lead to the erosion of suitable grassland in Kenya, with perhaps only 10% of suitable habitat remaining in the country (S. Thomsett in litt. 2010). Although cultural beliefs offered some protection in the past in Kenya, recent generations tend not to hold such values, and the species may be directly persecuted as a result (S. Thomsett in litt. 2010). Persecution may occur directly because the species breaks window panes by attacking its own reflection in glass (incurring costs and creating human-wildlife conflict), indirectly by consuming poisoned bait meant for other species, and it is sometimes killed for traditional rituals against drought (del Hoyo et al. 2001; K. Morrison and Y. Friedmann in litt. 2005; L. Kemp in litt. 2016). In South Africa and Zimbabwe, where these beliefs are upheld, there is actually a significant protection given to this species because it has high cultural importance, and these beliefs outweigh any offtake for traditional use (L. Kemp in litt. 2016). Collisions with powerlines may also be a threat in South Africa (K. Morrison and Y. Friedmann in litt. 2005), although only one such mortality has been recorded and more mortalities may occur from electrocution by standing on step-down transformer boxes - especially if an insect nest has been built on or near the box which could act as an attractant for the species (L. Kemp in litt. 2016; R. Little in litt. 2016). Such threats are exacerbated by the slow reproductive rate and maturation, longevity and social structure of the species (S. Thomsett in litt. 2010). This species can be susceptible to Newcastle's Disease Virus (L. Kemp in litt. 2016), and may be under threat from stepping on land mines in areas of conflict (L. Kemp in litt. 2016)."

Human disturbance can be extremely detrimental to bat colonies, especially to non-volant young and hibernating adults, depending on the season and severity of the disturbance. Mines that are in close proximity to roads, towns, hiking trails or camp grounds are more susceptible to disturbance then those in remote areas with difficult access. There is a need for greater assurance that roosts will remain undisturbed and that future (potential) roost sites will be left when managing for bats in pinyon-juniper habitat. Ideally, management should aim to sustain adequate food, water, and roost sites in close proximity to one another (Klingel 2000)."

However, urban populations may also be declining (Brichetti et al. 2008, Summers-Smith and Sharpe 2020), and so this is unlikely to be the sole cause of population declines in this species. The species is predated by cats (Mori et al. 2019)."

    "threats_description": "Invasive mammals were responsible for all known and suspected colony extinctions in the past and pose an ongoing threat by being present in all the larger colonies and former colonies (McChesney and Tershy 1998). Feral cats Felis catus depredate chicks and adults. Heavy cat predation was recorded on North Coronado until the mid-1990s (Jehl and Bond 1975, Drost and Lewis 1995). The cat population at Catalina was most recently estimated at 600-750 individuals (Guttila and Stapp 2010) and eradication of cats and rats on the island has been regarded as \u2018not currently feasible\u2019 (Whitworth et al. 2014). Despite this however, many introduced predators have been removed from a number of breeding islands in recent decades (McChesney and Tershy 1998, Keitt 2005, Birt et al. 2012) with post-eradication increases noted (Whitworth and Carter 2017); the eradication of cats on some islands off the coast of western Baja California (Islas Coronado, Todos Santos, San Mart\u00edn and San Benito) in the late-1990s has likely resulted in recent population increases in such localities (Whitworth et al. 2020). Black Rats Rattus rattus prey on murrelet eggs and adults (Whitworth et al. 2014). Eradication of rats at Anacapa Island in 2001\u20132002 greatly improved murrelet hatching success in the following years (2003\u20132010) (Whitworth et al. 2005, 2013), with 191% more eggs hatching and 94% fewer nests being depredated (Newton et al. 2016). Hatching success remains very low on islands including St. Clementine however, a result of ongoing predation by foxes and black rats (Whitworth et al. 2018). House Mice Mus musculus were recently introduced to the Coronados Islands, and Deer Mice Peromyscus maniculatus anacapae (native to nearby Cedros Island) have also been introduced to the San Benito Islands. Deer Mice depredated 46% of all monitored eggs on Santa Barbara (Murray et al. 1983), which is the largest known breeding site for the species (Howard et al. 2014). However, on Anacapa, Deer Mice were established long before the introduction of rats, precluding them from consideration as the cause of declines there (Jones et al. 2005). Another problematic native species is the Barn Owl Tyto alba. Annual estimates of owl predation on Santa Barbara range from 11 to 172 individuals (Thomsen and Harvey 2012, Thomsen et al. 2013, Nur et al. 2013). Population growth modelling based on data collected between 1991 and 2010, resulted in an estimate of a 1.17% population decline owing to owl predation, and projections of a hypothetical 50-80% reduction in predation pressure could potentially result in a 1.15-2.54% positive growth rate, barring an increase in egg depredation from island mouse populations (Nur et al. 2013). This assessment implicated the role of Barn Owls in the suppression of the Scripps\u2019s Murrelet population recovery on Santa Barbara Island although recent evidence suggests that the presence of Barn Owls on Santa Barbara may have an indirect positive influence on Murrelet egg survival through increased predation on deer mice, and resultantly reduced egg predation from the mice themselves (Thomsen and Green 2016). Such interactions however, have been shown to shift with changing El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) rainfall conditions as changing rainfall, vegetation abundance and resultantly deer mouse populations can result in 15-fold increases in the predation of Murrelet by Owls in the absence of mice as a food source (Thomsen et al. 2018). It has recently been evidenced that fecundity is dramatically reduced during drought years due to enhanced egg predation by deer mice and population declines may result (Thomsen and Green 2019). Any increase in the frequency or severity of drought conditions will likely increase the rate of population decline in response. Various forms of pollution are threatening the species. The potential impacts of large and small oil spills in congregation waters near breeding islands is of great concern (Carter et al. 2000, Burkett et al. 2003). Long Beach Harbour is the largest oil port in western North America, with daily arrivals and departures of large oil tankers (USFWS 2005). Frequent oil spills occur in the vicinity of Long Beach Harbour, but most have not affected waters near Catalina (Carter 2003, Whitworth et al. 2014). As stated by Drost and Lewis (1995), pollution from offshore oil-wells or the Los Angeles oil-tanker lane could potentially extirpate the species from the south California Bight. Organochlorine pollutants are considered not to have a current significant effect on murrelets breeding at Catalina, but may have caused reduced reproduction or population size in the past, especially between the 1940s and 1970s, prior to the end of production and dumping of DDT in southern California waters (Drost and Lewis 1995, Whitworth et al. 2014). The potential impacts of bright lights used by squid fishing boats near breeding colonies is another concern, potentially causing disorientation and elevated predation pressures. Many owl-predated murrelets were found during a period of intense inshore squid fishing around Santa Catalina and disturbance from related activities could discourage nest-visitation and possibly cause collision mortalities (Whitworth et al. 2014). Human disturbance has been identified as a cause of nest abandonment and a major threat to the species (Howard et al. 2015). The two highest rates of abandonment on record were observed at the Dock and the Bunkhouse plots, which are directly associated with human structures. The human disturbance associated with these sites may also affect the remaining nesting birds. Machinery operations at the dock include high decibel engine noise and vibration of the dock structure, which along with frequent traffic, could be affecting nesting murrelets beneath the decking of these structures (Howard et al. 2015).Extreme fluctuations of sea surface temperature related to ENSO, are likely to affect food availability for the species, though the impact of such events appears to be small due to their generalist prey (USFWS 2016). In addition, the species's foraging behaviour puts it at risk from gill-net fisheries, although very few incidences have been reported (Carter et al. 2000). No mortality has been reported in nearshore gill-net fisheries in which other seabirds have relatively high bycatch rates (Pacific Seabird Group undated). However, the white seabass gill-net fishery operating around the northern California Channel Islands has very little observer coverage, potentially indicating that bycatch incidence has been underestimated or completely overlooked (Pacific Seabird Group undated)."

Some habitat is being lost to residential/commercial development, but often this species occurs in inaccessible, rugged terrain that affords natural protection from grazing and development, and a great deal of suitable habitat remains. Some subpopulations may be vulnerable to habitat loss or degradation from renewable energy development, but the scope of this over the next 10 years appears to be negligible. Some local subpopulations along roads probably are threatened by overcollecting and mortality from vehicles. This is a popular species in the pet trade, and collectors often target this snake; however, it is difficult to find and collect in quantity."

    "threats_description": "The species faces similar threats to other African vultures, being susceptible to habitat conversion to agro-pastoral systems, loss of wild ungulates leading to a reduced availability of carrion, hunting for trade, persecution and poisoning (Ogada et al. 2016). In East Africa, the primary issue is poisoning (particularly from the highly toxic pesticide carbofuran), which occurs primarily outside protected areas; the large range sizes of this and G. africanus puts them both at significant risk as it means they inevitably spend considerable time outside protected areas (Ogada and Keesing 2010, Otieno et al. 2010, Kendall and Virani 2012). In addition, the ungulate wildlife populations on which this species relies have declined precipitously throughout East Africa, even in protected areas (Western et al. 2009). In 2007, diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, and which is fatal to Gyps spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses, was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2007). In addition, it was reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden in litt. 2007) and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International 2007). The West African population has been heavily exploited for trade, with birds commonly sold in fetish markets (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004, Nikolaus 2006, Buij et al. 2015). It is one of the most commonly traded vultures in West and Central African markets, with numbers traded (1,128-1,692 individuals over a six year period in West Africa) probably representing a significant proportion of the regional population (Buij et al. 2015), with vultures being used in traditional medicine (W. Goodwin in litt. 2016). The Dogon of central Mali climb the Hombori cliffs to take eggs and chicks of this species (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). The decline and possible extirpation in Nigeria appears to be entirely attributable to the trade in vulture parts for traditional juju practices (P. Hall in litt. 2011). It is apparently also captured for international trade. In 2005, 30 birds were reportedly confiscated by the Italian authorities (F. Genero in litt. 2005). Disturbance, especially from climbers, is a particular problem for this species. In Mali, the Hombori and Dyounde massifs are dotted with at least 47 climbing routes, on which expeditions take place every year, mainly during the species's breeding season. However, the impact of these activities is not known (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). Climate change may be causing a shift in suitable habitat, which may explain the increased sightings in Northern Africa and the Iberian peninsula (Garrido et al. 2020). Electrocution and collision with power lines may pose a significant threat (Ogada et al. 2016; Garrido et al. 2020)."

    "threats_description": "The Sonoran Spiny-tailed Iguana is primarily threatened by habitat destruction caused by human activities (urbanization, agriculture, and cattle ranching). In regions where they are not hunted, these iguanas have a certain tolerance to semi-urbanized areas (small villages and isolated houses), even taking advantage of them (e.g., foraging around crops, using fence posts and walls as retreats). However, in these areas iguanas are threatened by feral and free-roaming cats and dogs, and this is likely to impact the survivability of hatchlings and juveniles in particular. The affect these predators have on the overall population trend is unknown.In the western and central part of their range, large-scale agriculture and ranching displaces iguanas and fragments the population. This may reduce their genetic variability to some degree, and may become a future threat with the expansion of human development. Because adult iguanas are currently found in habitats that vary widely in quality (e.g., pristine forests and cities), it is unclear what level of human modification is still compatible with a stable iguana population.In the south, this species hybridizes easily with the Guerreran Spiny-tailed Iguana (Ctenosaura pectinata). It is unknown when these two species started hybridizing, or if human processes have influenced the rate. It is also unknown to what extent the hybrid population outnumbers the pure individuals. Sampling for genetic analysis of these iguanas suggested hybridization in this contact zone may be quite high (Zarza 2008)."

    "threats_description": "Afro-Asiatic wildcats are considered to be threatened by domestic cats and hybridization is widespread across their range (Yamaguchi et al. 2015, Yu et al. 2021). However, a recent study (Le Roux et al. 2015), showed that wildcat populations in South Africa appear to be genetically pure, with low levels of hybridization, and protected areas play an important role in maintaining genetic purity by reducing the likelihood of contact with domestic cats. There is insufficient information on the level of hybridization with domestic cats in other parts of the range, and therefore, this threat should not be underestimated. Feral domestic cats also compete with wildcats for prey and space, and there is a high potential for disease transmission between domestic cats and wildcats (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Yamaguchi et al. 1996, Daniels et al. 1999, Macdonald et al. 2004).Other threats include significant human-caused mortality, especially road kills and retaliatory killing as a consequence of depredation on livestock and poultry (Ghoddousi et al. 2016, F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2019). Moreover, wildcats are caught as bycatch in traps set for other species (Hashim and Mahgoub 2008, Stuart et al. 2013, Ghoddousi et al. 2016, A. Samna pers. comm. 2019, F. Belbachir pers. obs. 2019). Afro-Asiatic wildcats are also killed as pests in southern Africa, although this does not seem to have resulted in population declines (Stuart et al. 2013). Habitat loss is also known as one of the threats to Afro-Asiatic wildcats. For example, the expansion of cotton plantations and gas fields in China or development of so called \u2018wasteland habitats\u2019 in India (Sharma 1998) have reduced their suitable habitat. However, wildcats persist in cultivated landscapes with increased rodent population densities (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), although these are the areas where hybridization with domestic cats occurs and spreads. Moreover, free-ranging dogs kill wildcats and may increase their mortality rate, especially along protected area boundaries where they occur in significant numbers (TAWIRI 2009). Finally, the impacts of uncontrolled breeding of pure wildcats and selling of individuals as pets are unknown (Herbst et al. 2016)."

Another threat is hybridization with congeneric species (Lynch Alfaro et al. 2014). The species is considered a crop pest in some areas (in sugar cane and pine plantations). Otherwise, it is generally scarce except in the larger protected areas."

    "threats_description": "The implementation of control measures (promoted by ranchers) by official organizations, coupled with the use of non-selective methods of capture such as poison, represent the main threats for the Pampas Fox. Fox control by government agencies involves the use of bounty systems without any serious studies on population abundance or the real damage that this species may cause. In rural areas, direct persecution in retaliation for or prevention of predation on lambs is also common, even where hunting is officially illegal and despite the true economic impact of predation being unquantified (Lucherini and Luengos Vidal 2008, M. Lucherini pers. obs. 2015).Most of the species' range has suffered massive habitat alteration. For instance, the Pampas, which represents a large proportion of the species' distribution range, has been affected by extensive cattle breeding and agriculture. Approximately 0.1% of the original 500,000 km\u00b2 range remains unaffected. However, due to the species' adaptability, the Pampas Fox seems able to withstand the loss and degradation of its natural habitat, as well as hunting pressure. Since no studies are available on its population dynamics in rural ecosystems, caution is required, since the sum of these threats may eventually promote the depletion of fox populations. Hunting pressure has resulted in diminished populations in the provinces of Tucum\u00e1n (Barquez et al. 1991) and Salta (Cajal 1986) of north-western Argentina."

    "threats_description": "Outside protected areas, the Brown Hyaena may come into conflict with humans, and they are often shot, poisoned, trapped and hunted with dogs in predator eradication or control programmes, or inadvertently killed in non-selective control programs (Mills 1998). Brown Hyaena body parts are used in traditional medicine and Brown Hyaenas are also often unintentional victims of lethal problem animal control through poisons and poaching through snares (I. Wiesel, C. Edwards, L. Boast and R. Yarnell pers. comms. 2014). Lethal control remains the most predominant form of conflict resolution. The Brown Hyaena is regarded as a threat to livestock in some areas, and over 72% of livestock owners in Namibia believe that the Brown Hyaena is responsible for losses (Lindsey et al. 2013), despite the finding that Brown Hyaenas very seldom prey on livestock (Maude and Mills 2005). In South Africa's North West Province 40% of livestock owners regard the Brown Hyaena as a problem animal (Thorn 2008), but in the North West Province, only 6% of surveyed farmers admit to having killed Brown Hyaenas on their property (St John et al. 2011). Persecution in small stock areas in Namibia has lead to the local extinction of Brown Hyaenas in the southeastern parts of that country, where increasing conflict may lead to further population decline."

    "threats_description": "Past population declines resulted from the heavy use of organochlorine and other pesticides in the 1950s-1960s (Orta and Boesman 2013). Use of anticoagulant rodenticides is of increasing concern (Roos et al. 2021), and studies in southwest Spain suggest that some individuals may be exposed to toxic levels of inorganic elements (Manzano et al. 2021). In Malta, the species was exterminated by shooting, though it has since returned (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The population in much of the rest of Europe has shown a more recent steady decline, thought to be due to agricultural intensification (Snow and Perrins 1998). In its West African range, the species is vulnerable to habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing and fire as well as exposure to pesticides (Thiollay 2007). The species is vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012). Collision or electrocution from electricity cables may pose a threat in some areas (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018). Predation by Northern Goshawks may limit populations in some areas (Petty et al. 2003)."

Kusrini pers. comm. May 2017). In 2013, individuals of these two introduced species were observed again in the national park, but requests for their removal were not acknowledged and they may still be a problem for the tadpoles of this species in that locality. This species is also used at a very small-scale as fish bait.It has recently tested positive for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, although there are currently no reports of population declines for this species (Kusrini et al. 2008)."

The expansion of plantations may be beneficial, but the logging of areas will likely affect the species, with nests potentially being lost (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). However, there is evidence that the species is nesting in eucalyptus plantations (Hirsch et al. 2020). Farm reservoirs may prove to be a threat to this species as large raptors are known to drown in them (Anderson et al. 1999)."

Burning of vegetation is one of the most commonly recorded pressures in Ireland at both breeding and non-breeding sites (Caravaggi et al. 2019; O'Donoghue 2020). Persecution is still severe locally, for example on managed grouse moors of Scotland; in 2013 not a single pair successfully nested in England (Pitches 2013), despite the fact that there is estimated habitat for more than 300 pairs (Fielding et al. 2011). Of 117 Hen Harrier chicks satellite tagged in the UK between 2015 and 2019, only 15 were still alive in June 2020, most having gone missing in suspicious circumstances (RSPB 2020). The species is also shot illegally in central and eastern Europe (Tucker and Heath 1994). In the Czech Republic, wild boar Sus scrofa may pose a major threat to nesting birds (Kren 2000 in Global Raptor Information Network 2015)."

Illegal hunting and live capture for the pet trade pose additional threats (Bartlett 2007, Campbell et al. 2008, 2015; Cheyne et al. 2016). Between 1973 and 2017, Borneo overall has lost an average of 1% of its forest cover annually (Gaveau et al. 2014, 2018), and the most recent Global Forest Watch data indicates this rate continues. If conditions do not change, a close to 50% loss of suitable habitat can be anticipated over the course of three generations (45 years). That, coupled with ongoing hunting and live capture for the pet trade (Nijman 2005) is sufficient to consider Hylobates funereus an Endangered species."

    "threats_description": "Locally, Common Genets have been and are still killed for their meat, body parts, skin and fur. In Portugal this species is illegally killed in predator trapping for hunting management and this, together with road-kills, may be the most important sources of anthropogenic mortality. In south Portugal, although Genets seem to avoid highways, they are particularly sensitive to national roads (two paved lanes). Two thirds of the road-kills recorded over a 10-year period were subadults and the road-kill index was ca 12.8 individuals/100 km/year (F. Carvalho unpubl. data). Overall, however, it is believed that these sources or mortality do not currently threaten local populations. The only exception concerns Ibiza, where the Genet is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of habitat caused by urbanisation and infrastructure and tourism development."
